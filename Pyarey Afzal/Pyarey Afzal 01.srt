What are you doing?

8
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,228
Did you see his speed?

9
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,175
Then play accordingly!

10
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:04,244
Umpire Sir!

11
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:05,895
It's my family!

12
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,548
Hello --

13
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,662
Misbah hit two sixes?

14
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:14,482
The wretch who couldn't hit a six on a hundred balls scored two sixes on two balls?

15
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:17,288
Don't worry. India will win this.

16
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:22,208
Raise the stakes.

17
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:25,481
I'm losing 7,000 elsewhere.

18
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:27,637
Alright, I'll pay you 7,000.

19
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,189
Bugger!

20
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,950
One minute!

21
00:03:02,486 --> 00:03:04,580
Hey... Make it 8,000, will you?

22
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,463
It'll save you two and earn me one.

23
00:03:06,463 --> 00:03:07,867
I'm facing a loss somewhere else.

24
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,672
No way!

25
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,437
Come here! Here!

26
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:45,055
No, back -- go back -- there

27
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:56,583
Alright, I'll pay you 8,500.

28
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:00,056
But you're paying me 5,000 if we lose this.

29
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,639
He's off the team after this.

30
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,127
The bugger blackmails on the crease!

31
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,690
Saw that?

32
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,232
Looks like we've lost it, Captain!

33
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:39,838
Shut up!

34
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:51,323
Saw that?

35
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:54,530
Go and get 10,000 from Babur.

36
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,034
The match closes with the next ball.

37
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,633
We've won, Captain!

38
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,121
No, it's <i>that wretch</i> who's won.

39
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:13,829
We're just getting 1,500 bucks.

40
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:30,210
God is the greatest...

41
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,199
Farah!

42
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,898
Here she comes.

43
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,632
Peace be upon you.
-God protect you from the evil eye. God be praised.

44
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,548
You don't know how long he's been gloomy.

45
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:34,771
Look at him gladden at the very sight of you!

46
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:36,761
I'll -- be back.

47
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:40,820
Please don't leave without fixing the date.

48
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,337
Let your father come.

49
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:44,525
I'll say it plainly:

50
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:48,025
I'll have dinner only when you've fixed the date.

51
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,528
And you better say something too.

52
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:55,054
Last time, you remained quiet, and Dad said he'd think.

53
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:01,284
No... He's not a dosser.

54
00:07:01,284 --> 00:07:03,582
He just couldn't get a job after doing his BA.

55
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:06,451
He spends some time with the lads.

56
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,498
One of them must be a loafer.

57
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:11,498
That's got him a bad name, too.

58
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:15,396
You know the Reverend only too well.

59
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:20,085
He calls him a sinner if he isn't back before dusk.

60
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,565
Don't talk about Beenish.

61
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:25,038
She'd clearly told me on Eid -

62
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,724
'I accept, Aunt, but <i>he</i> does not'.

63
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,453
Uh -- no, Kulsoom --

64
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:34,169
Why won't he?

65
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:37,658
He must be teasing her -- just for fun.

66
00:07:38,723 --> 00:07:41,986
No, no, no -- Kulsoom, he's 25, not 28.

67
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:48,956
In fact, he's 25 just because the Reverend wrote it a year older to get him admitted to school.

68
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:49,966
Here.

69
00:07:49,966 --> 00:07:54,102
24,000.

70
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:58,337
That makes for a total of

71
00:07:58,337 --> 00:07:59,626
98,000.

72
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,972
Where do you get so much money from?

73
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,130
What do you mean?

74
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,017
I work hard; I earn it.

75
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,103
You're lying.

76
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:10,903
If you also think I'm lying, Dad's going to rush to the police station with his rants about religious values!

77
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:12,775
He'll get me booked!

78
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,501
You're into gambling, aren't you?

79
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:16,088
What?

80
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,466
As if that's even possible!

81
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:22,829
Reverend Subhanallah's son is into gambling?

82
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:25,124
You're not a sister.

83
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:26,734
You're a sworn enemy.

84
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,232
What if Dad found out?

85
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:29,651
It's just a matter of two days.

86
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:32,658
I'll deposit it in a bank once I open an account.

87
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,403
Alright, I'll keep it.

88
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:35,487
But please

89
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:38,252
Tell me about your job someday.

90
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:39,629
Doubting me again?

91
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:40,957
No.

92
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:43,598
All I want is that if Dad gives his judgement on this matter, I can say firmly,

93
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:46,395
'This is my brother's hard-earned money'.

94
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,350
Don't talk about him.

95
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,254
He even thinks it's unlawful to deposit money at a bank.

96
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,722
Keep it inside, quick.

97
00:08:52,722 --> 00:08:56,982
Mum will start on it if she saw it.

98
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:25,308
This is your room.

99
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:29,012
Have a look and let me know if you need anything.

100
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,917
But I stayed in the room upstairs last time...

101
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:39,199
This is the best room in the house.

102
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:43,353
As the date is fixed, you rise in status.

103
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:46,236
But...

104
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,491
But what?

105
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:49,744
You don't like it?

106
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:53,416
The room's alright, but...

107
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,390
I would often glimpse <i>her</i> from the room upstairs.

108
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,288
Shall I arrange a meeting?

109
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:01,507
Is it possible?

110
00:10:01,507 --> 00:10:02,883
She's said it herself this time

111
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:06,728
Before Dad comes back, you are invited to meet her on the terrace.

112
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,080
When does he come back?

113
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,018
Ask when you're invited!
-When?

114
00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,455
9 o'clock sharp.

115
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:15,956
Dad comes back at 10.

116
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:18,066
You've got 40 minutes.

117
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:21,373
Mind if I share a few precautional musings about the meeting?

118
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:22,378
Please.

119
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:25,208
Talk from afar.

120
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,169
And don't talk about your many cars and châteaux.

121
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:31,813
Talk about your deep love!

122
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,235
Of course...

123
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,829
If she asks something, give a thoughtful answer.

124
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:37,706
Sure.

125
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:42,279
And even if she comes close, don't place your hand on her shoulder or hand!

126
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,679
I won't, but please tell me - she accepts this espousal, right?

127
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,030
Did you see her cheeks redden at the sight of you?

128
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:54,964
Redden --?
-<i>I</i> did!

129
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:58,050
It means she's <i>very</i> happy.

130
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:03,301
But when I tried to talk to her,

131
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,723
She had a go at me -- so to speak.

132
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:07,501
You were a stranger then.

133
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,026
You were just the son of a friend of Dad's.

134
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:13,222
Dad's got many friends, and they've got many sons.

135
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:15,972
She doesn't talk to all of them.

136
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:18,625
Now I get it...

137
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:22,338
When the date is decided,

138
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:24,528
Gently place your hand on hers.

139
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:27,078
I'm sure she won't push you away then!

140
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,390
Did you say it?

141
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

142
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,777
What did he say?

143
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:56,759
He said he wouldn't place his hand on your shoulder or hand.

144
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,224
What?

145
00:11:58,533 --> 00:11:59,981
Did he intend to?

146
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,170
No.

147
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,318
I just forbade him as a precaution.

148
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:06,934
Mum says nothing's written when it comes to the intentions of men.

149
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,661
Who knows - he might have reached for your hand the moment you started talking.

150
00:12:09,661 --> 00:12:12,988
That's why I warned him.

151
00:12:12,988 --> 00:12:14,838
Alright.

152
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,307
I've told him to meet you at 9 o'clock.

153
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:18,917
I'd said 9.30.

154
00:12:18,917 --> 00:12:20,492
Dad said he'd be back at 10.

155
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:23,536
What if he got back at 9.30?

156
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:25,051
Fine.

157
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:26,901
Alright then.

158
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,324
Why do you want to meet him though?

159
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,214
Is there any good reason?

160
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:40,777
It may help me someday.

161
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:43,833
I'll tell you everything once I'm done,

162
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,522
And I pray that <i>everything</i> will help you someday!

163
00:12:47,522 --> 00:12:51,260
Alright. I'll be with Mum and Aunt. Go up as soon as the clock strikes 9.

164
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,590
Okay?

165
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,234
Ahh... Let my past remain ensepulchred beneath dust.

166
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:13,199
For my past is but obloquy to me.

167
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:15,146
Splendid!
-Great!

168
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:19,281
Reified by yearning, meed for my endeavours...

169
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:22,999
Is nothing but inglorious woe?

170
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:26,675
Do not chronicle my love before me;

171
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,958
Let me show the fortitude of my love.

172
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,705
Excellent!
-Well said!

173
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:36,998
And that ebrious gaze that abandoned me -

174
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:40,904
I was never one to admire it;

175
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:45,736
The very tresses, gaze, cheeks, and form,

176
00:13:45,736 --> 00:13:48,836
I can find elsewhere if so I desire;

177
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:50,233
Excellent!
-Great!

178
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,402
The lilies destined to blossom for them

179
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:56,104
Can blossom far from the reach of their gaze.

180
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:57,790
Lovely!
-That's great!

181
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,790
Very well said!
-That's the real deal!

182
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,413
Now you're talking like a man!

183
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:07,383
Forget the harpy and marry someone better!

184
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,648
Rent a house in front of hers.

185
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,884
Show her you're a man!

186
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,283
I bet, she'll file for divorce within moments!

187
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:17,406
Called her again, did you?

188
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:18,330
Got scolded again?

189
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,980
No mate...

190
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,172
She hung up at the sound of my voice,

191
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,073
Then answered when I tried again,

192
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,772
And said, 'Who is it'?

193
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:28,319
I said, 'I'm Sajid'.

194
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,993
And she said, 'Sajid who'?

195
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,170
Do you get it?

196
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,179
It means skive off, chap.

197
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,723
'Leave me alone'!

198
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:41,081
That's it.

199
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,966
One of these days I'll curse you.

200
00:14:44,022 --> 00:14:48,438
I'll say, 'May you be accursed with such adoration'!

201
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,105
It scares me the way you keep on laughing to yourself.

202
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:58,110
Why?

203
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,843
I mean --

204
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:02,732
She writes to you twice a week, right?

205
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,170
What if she forgot one week?

206
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,450
As if that's possible!

207
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,645
She's not like your sweet Chanda;

208
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,952
She'd die without me.

209
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,632
Do you know what she's written this time?

210
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,144
You got her letter?

211
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:16,536
Oh, yeah... Today's Saturday, after all!

212
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,420
Read it out to us.

213
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,564
Hearing her words...

214
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:24,432
It feels as if one Chanda might've killed all affection, but another Chanda might just resurrect it.

215
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:26,077
Her name isn't Chanda!

216
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:28,560
So tell us her name today.

217
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,553
I have great respect for her.

218
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:31,954
I'll mention her honourably.

219
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:34,204
Some other day...

220
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,300
Hear her letter first.

221
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,285
Man was born for his compassion towards the suffering;

222
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:44,348
For there was no shortage of beings for subservience alone.

223
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:48,657
There was no shortage of divine spirits and angels to serve God.

224
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:50,602
Why was man born?

225
00:15:50,602 --> 00:15:53,582
Man was born for the pains he goes through, for his deeds of compassion,

226
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,715
Which is why the rights of servants --

227
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,027
Oh --

228
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,622
O Lord, I beg You to grant me the best of Your favours.

229
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:08,590
May you have a long life, son.

230
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,676
'Dear Afzal',

231
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:18,457
She <i>always</i> opens with 'Dear Afzal'!

232
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:21,651
Shut up! Go on, mate.

233
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,710
'How are you?'

234
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,178
'All well?'

235
00:16:27,178 --> 00:16:30,913
'I see the best in you whenever I see you.'

236
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:33,058
'Always fresh!'

237
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,788
Where do you meet?

238
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:36,580
Mum's the word!

239
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,776
Go on. Don't stop for his questions!

240
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:42,842
'You stay with me for but a few minutes,'

241
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:45,785
'Eager every second of it to leave.'

242
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:49,595
'I still wait for the day you will be before my eyes all night,'

243
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:54,058
'And I, like a devotee, shall relish every moment of my deity's presence...'

244
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:58,038
'When will it be, Afzal? And how?'

245
00:16:58,038 --> 00:17:01,206
'Seeing you vivifies me,'

246
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:06,613
'And the grim reaper seizes me the moment you leave.'

247
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:09,805
'I'd die without you.'

248
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,042
That's it?

249
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,382
That's it.

250
00:17:12,382 --> 00:17:15,936
For my sake, at least tell me her name.

251
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:19,087
I won't tell you that!

252
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,930
You and your 'I won't tell'.

253
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:37,106
Mehtab?

254
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,920
Yes?

255
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,210
Let's sit down, shall we?

256
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:13,699
Where should I sit?

257
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:17,744
Why, right here, with me.

258
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,480
If you want to ask something

259
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,230
Or say something, please do.

260
00:18:41,278 --> 00:18:43,719
All I want to say --

261
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:45,922
You're very beautiful.

262
00:18:45,922 --> 00:18:47,358
That's it?

263
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:49,305
Uh -- No...

264
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:53,733
When you softly called out, 'Mehtab',

265
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,268
I swear I nearly died at that moment.

266
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,844
Your voice is fatal.

267
00:18:59,121 --> 00:19:00,712
<i>Fatal</i>?

268
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:03,908
Uh -- I mean it -- in a sweet manner...

269
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:06,823
It touches my heart.

270
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,284
Where in Karachi do you live?

271
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,352
Block 2, Clifton.

272
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:14,678
Wow...

273
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:16,232
Your house must be quite the chateau.

274
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:18,405
Ye -- No.

275
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,802
It's small.

276
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,310
How many cars do you own?

277
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:29,455
Just -- just the one parked here.

278
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,033
As in... You're going through hard times?

279
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,974
No -- It's not like that.

280
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,474
Nothing like 'hard times' in my life.

281
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:40,518
Then why aren't you telling me?

282
00:19:40,568 --> 00:19:42,571
You've got five cars.

283
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,788
You own four houses -

284
00:19:43,788 --> 00:19:46,996
Two in Karachi, and two in Larkana.

285
00:19:50,498 --> 00:19:56,074
The thing is -- Lubna had warned against talking about houses and cars.

286
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:58,134
You'd be angry.

287
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,001
Monseigneur's here.

288
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,525
Peace be upon you, Dad.

289
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,730
And upon you, peace.

290
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,662
Aunt Shugufta and Mehtab are here.

291
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:30,883
Oh?

292
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:33,491
Aunt said she'd leave only after the date is decided.

293
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,500
Alright, I'll fix it today.

294
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,063
But tell me - she's happy, isn't she?

295
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:40,169
I think so...

296
00:21:32,481 --> 00:21:35,289
I want to study further.

297
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,000
Why not?

298
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,625
Even after I'm married.

299
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,953
I'm doing my Master's in Economics,

300
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:45,703
And I'll go to London for my MPhil.

301
00:21:46,422 --> 00:21:47,812
Why?

302
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:50,631
What do you mean?

303
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:52,584
What's wrong?

304
00:21:52,584 --> 00:21:55,706
And most importantly,

305
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:59,471
I want to get a job that's as glorious as it is grandiose!

306
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:01,838
<i>My wife</i> will work?

307
00:22:01,838 --> 00:22:03,507
No way!

308
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,921
Everyone will insult me.

309
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,020
Who?

310
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,458
Friends -- relatives -- all of them...

311
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:14,994
And in all honesty, you'd hardly have the time.

312
00:22:14,994 --> 00:22:17,047
You'll have to take care of me.

313
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:19,010
I'm so childlike.

314
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,308
I'll need you all the time.

315
00:22:21,556 --> 00:22:24,767
So -- won't you work?

316
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,408
I don't need to work.

317
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,752
I've got some 200 million in my account already.

318
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,869
I've lost track of how much I spend every year,

319
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:33,509
But the balance just refuses to come down.

320
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:35,345
You know why?

321
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:36,101
Why?

322
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:40,985
I get 20 million from just the land revenues.

323
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,288
So what'll we do after our marriage?

324
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:50,599
Have a jolly good time, of course!

325
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:01,054
What happened?

326
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,987
Was it something I said?

327
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:12,663
You know, when I was young --

328
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:14,050
Leave my hand!

329
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,828
I despise people like you

330
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:19,747
Who are in this world just to 'have a jolly good time'.

331
00:23:35,716 --> 00:23:38,546
Everything was fine until now.

332
00:23:38,546 --> 00:23:40,357
Then she started talking about her education.

333
00:23:40,357 --> 00:23:43,733
She said she'd go to London for her MPhil after our marriage.

334
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:45,212
Stupid, innit?

335
00:23:45,212 --> 00:23:48,712
I mean, London's best for honeymoon!

336
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,199
Lu -- Lubna!

337
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:48,107
What time is it?

338
00:24:48,107 --> 00:24:49,857
It's 10.

339
00:24:52,353 --> 00:24:54,823
Call Sofia

340
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:59,944
And tell her the match is not fit.

341
00:25:02,526 --> 00:25:04,409
What do you mean?

342
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,110
It means that Reverend Subhanallah won't allow

343
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:14,180
The wife to be cared for on money earned through gambling.

344
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,910
Gambling?

345
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:22,894
He's won 24,500 today,

346
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:30,566
And 16,000 of it in the match that Pakistan had lost.

347
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:31,819
Good Heavens!

348
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:36,189
I've heard he even smokes weed when he gets the chance.

349
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:40,899
And... Some girl writes him letters.

350
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:43,214
I don't know who she is,

351
00:25:43,214 --> 00:25:45,970
But, sitting with his friends,

352
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,030
He reads her lettes out to them.

353
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:55,593
You're starting to question yourself, aren't you?

354
00:25:55,593 --> 00:25:58,799
So am I...

355
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:03,524
When I teach the kids these days,

356
00:26:03,524 --> 00:26:05,531
It feels as if

357
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,279
They're staring at me,

358
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:11,211
Sniggering... 'Look at your own son',

359
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:14,792
'And look at what you talk about'.

360
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:19,625
Even the prayers lack that spirit.

361
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:24,407
Every moment, a fear stings at me as I step out of the Mosque...

362
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:26,705
That the police

363
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:32,903
May be at the doorstep holding that scoundrel by his collar.

364
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:37,556
Tell him to leave this place!

365
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:44,319
For the righteous and the sinful cannot live together.

366
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:47,051
Is it only an accusation,

367
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:50,987
Or do you have proof of it as well?

368
00:26:52,073 --> 00:26:54,543
I'm not accepting it without evidence.

369
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:56,947
I come with reliable information.

370
00:26:56,947 --> 00:27:00,248
One of these days, you were struck with calamity at 'information'.

371
00:27:00,248 --> 00:27:05,069
You'd even told me not to repeat it unless proven true.

372
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,167
Present evidence if you have any,

373
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:12,200
Else in this matter of crime and punishment, your word cannot be taken for the truth.

374
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,396
And if you have evidence,

375
00:27:14,396 --> 00:27:16,664
I swear by you

376
00:27:16,664 --> 00:27:20,205
I would hit him with my shoes a hundred times.

377
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:23,728
I'll order him to leave this place myself,

378
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:28,728
For the righteous and the sinful cannot live together.

379
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:57,438
I don't accept it!

380
00:27:57,438 --> 00:28:00,790
Tell Dad I'm not marrying Mehtab Chawla.

381
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:03,183
You should've said this earlier.

382
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,207
Now they've gathered to decide the date.

383
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:07,465
It's not the end of the world!

384
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,271
Go and whisper into his ears; tell him --

385
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,389
-- That I don't accept it.

386
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,548
He'll get up instantly.

387
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,694
You're strange.

388
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,209
You were enjoying the feast!

389
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,784
What happened when you swallowed what you bit?

390
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:24,037
I just can't swallow this one!

391
00:28:25,682 --> 00:28:28,034
Can't do anything now.

392
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,724
For my sake,

393
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:34,848
Tell Mum. I'll handle the rest.

394
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:38,248
Alright, I'll tell her.

395
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:41,010
Please.

396
00:28:49,223 --> 00:28:52,154
What if he died when he heard it?

397
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,956
There's a possibility he might...

398
00:28:55,956 --> 00:28:58,243
Go!

399
00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:04,736
Don't lie to me.

400
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:08,624
You won 8,000 in the local match, and 16,000 when Pakistan lost.

401
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:09,488
What?

402
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:11,542
I swea --

403
00:29:13,973 --> 00:29:15,285
Yes, I swear.

404
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:16,936
You're lying again.

405
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,973
Dad knows everything.

406
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:23,964
He mentioned everything and said that the righteous and the sinful cannot live together.

407
00:29:23,964 --> 00:29:25,262
Does Mum believe it?

408
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:29,012
Don't talk about her; <i>I</i> believe it!

409
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:33,532
I also know that the 98,000 you kept with me - You won it all in gambling!

410
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:35,876
And who's this girl who writes letters to you?

411
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:37,715
Girl?

412
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,636
Did you say it?

413
00:29:52,636 --> 00:29:53,981
Yes.

414
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,745
How'd it go? Who did you talk to?

415
00:29:56,745 --> 00:29:57,826
Mum.

416
00:29:57,826 --> 00:29:59,124
Great! Then?

417
00:29:59,124 --> 00:29:59,879
I know.

418
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,688
Mum would've said it flatly -

419
00:30:02,688 --> 00:30:04,802
'Leave it, Ibrahim, she doesn't accept it'.

420
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:05,959
Isn't it?

421
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,102
It isn't.

422
00:30:07,102 --> 00:30:10,062
Mum stuffed this sweet into my mouth the moment she heard it.

423
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:13,175
Gave me this plate of sweets, and said, 'Give it to her'.

424
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:17,050
The 15th of December is the big day.

425
00:30:30,252 --> 00:30:31,273
Who is it?

426
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:33,202
It's me, Afzal.

427
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:38,877
Had your dinner?

428
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,587
Yes.

429
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:42,777
Go and sleep then.

430
00:31:22,884 --> 00:31:24,139
Peace be upon you.

431
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:27,617
And upon you, peace.

432
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:30,312
May you live long.

433
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,715
Is anyone coming, or will you go on your own?

434
00:31:32,715 --> 00:31:36,883
Who would come? I'll go myself.

435
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,516
Did he come?

436
00:31:43,516 --> 00:31:45,150
Yes.

437
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:50,150
I figured as much.

438
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:53,018
I'll go and rouse him.

439
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:55,089
He can drop you.

440
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,089
Leave it be.

441
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,245
Shame on he who calls himself a believer,

442
00:32:00,245 --> 00:32:07,113
And drops another at the Mosque and leaves.

443
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:10,911
Tell him when he wakes up,

444
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:15,431
I'd like to meet him before noon.

445
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,321
And remember, if you're listening,

446
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:28,557
Today's meeting will be more important than your conventicles!

447
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:43,060
I love someone else.

448
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:44,740
What?

449
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,821
Did you hear that?

450
00:32:45,821 --> 00:32:48,925
He'll be struck by lightning to hear this.

451
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,265
I hear

452
00:32:50,265 --> 00:32:53,599
He's staying here to celebrate.

453
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,252
And if he's staying,

454
00:32:55,252 --> 00:32:58,198
I'll meet him again tonight.

455
00:32:58,198 --> 00:33:01,146
What do you intend to do?

456
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,489
What does it look like?

457
00:33:02,489 --> 00:33:05,364
With two teardrops, I'll say,

458
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:08,215
'I'm sorry, Mehtab',

459
00:33:08,215 --> 00:33:11,650
'But it's important that you know the truth before our marriage'.

460
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,147
'Before our marriage'?

461
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:17,157
'It'd hurt you far more if someone else told you later on'.

462
00:33:17,157 --> 00:33:19,749
Honestly, what is it?

463
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:24,149
'I love someone else'.

464
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:26,696
'Truly'.

465
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,699
'I've loved him since our schooldays'.

466
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,475
'We used to write letters to each other',

467
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:36,025
'But now, we talk over the phone for hours'.

468
00:33:36,025 --> 00:33:37,400
'We'd sworn oaths',

469
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,714
'Made promises',

470
00:33:38,714 --> 00:33:42,186
'To live and die together'.

471
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,729
'But what good is it now'...

472
00:33:43,729 --> 00:33:45,506
'Now that I'm getting married off to you'...

473
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:47,516
'I have to be yours'.

474
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:49,446
A fib.
-Might as well be!

475
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,206
But <i>he</i> will believe it.

476
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:54,144
He'd die for real this time!

477
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:55,948
He won't.

478
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:58,807
He'd much rather kill his dreams,

479
00:33:58,807 --> 00:34:00,063
And say as he leaves,

480
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:02,142
'No way I'm marrying her'!

481
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:03,022
Great.

482
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:04,381
Were it so easy...

483
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:06,126
Will Dad stay quiet?

484
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:08,859
Will he hurl abuses at them?
-No.

485
00:34:08,859 --> 00:34:12,207
He'll ask Mehtab's Mum why he was rejected.

486
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:15,232
And she will ask him, 'What happened so suddenly'?

487
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:17,304
'You've changed after a second meeting'.

488
00:34:17,304 --> 00:34:19,366
Don't worry.

489
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:21,776
He'll change.

490
00:34:33,461 --> 00:34:34,930
Halt!

491
00:34:36,445 --> 00:34:38,978
What are you doing?

492
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:41,170
Oh! It's you, Reverend.

493
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,444
Peace be upon you.

494
00:34:42,444 --> 00:34:44,370
And upon you, peace.

495
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,869
This man 'ere's a thief.

496
00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:48,001
Stole a mobile and tried to make a run for it.

497
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:50,906
Round him up and get him in the car.

498
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,803
You're going to the Mosque?

499
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:54,051
Yes.

500
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,455
Shall I drop you?

501
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:56,693
No --

502
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:59,471
I'll go on my own. Please, do your duty.

503
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:01,450
With peace.

504
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:16,176
Have some tea

505
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:18,305
Or you'll catch a cold.

506
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:20,450
Thanks.

507
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:23,834
Dad's left?

508
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:26,125
Yes.

509
00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:32,228
Why are you following me?

510
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:34,311
Just a second.

511
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,127
You're into gambling, aren't you?

512
00:35:49,127 --> 00:35:52,200
You give me all your winnings, right?

513
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:05,440
[Call to prayer]

514
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:03,167
These pennies will, one day, become serpents and scorpions.

515
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:06,696
They sting Dad today; they might as well sting you tomorrow.

516
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:07,839
Leave it be.

517
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,756
It's my hard-earned money.

518
00:36:10,756 --> 00:36:13,181
You smoke weed.

519
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:23,779
A lie!

520
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,999
God forgive!

521
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:30,681
Alright, give me the keys to your cupboard.

522
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:31,888
What's in the cupboard?

523
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:33,573
Her letters

524
00:36:33,573 --> 00:36:36,906
That you read out to your friends.

525
00:36:36,906 --> 00:36:40,179
The unholy trinity of your sins...

526
00:36:40,179 --> 00:36:42,955
Dad knows everything.

527
00:36:42,955 --> 00:36:45,658
You should be ashamed of yourself, Afzal.

528
00:36:45,658 --> 00:36:49,396
She writes you letters, and you read them out to your friends?

529
00:36:49,396 --> 00:36:52,975
Like a pallbearer of her honour!

530
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,444
Take this tea back,

531
00:37:01,444 --> 00:37:02,809
And leave.

532
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:05,965
Don't accuse me like Dad.

533
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,700
Swear that it's all false.

534
00:37:34,613 --> 00:37:36,945
Who's she?

535
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,100
I won't tell you her name.

536
00:37:40,893 --> 00:37:42,639
I've sworn to her.

537
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:45,067
And what about Beenish?

538
00:37:45,142 --> 00:37:46,823
Beenish?

539
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:51,011
Aunt Sofia's daughter?

540
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,792
What's up with her <i>now</i>?

541
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,742
Mum's decided to get you married to her.

542
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:59,043
Blimey --

543
00:37:59,091 --> 00:38:02,459
She's coming here in a few days.

544
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,356
Beenish too?

545
00:38:04,356 --> 00:38:06,084
Perhaps.

546
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:09,687
Let them come.

547
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,999
Let <i>her</i> come too?

548
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:15,986
I'll give her the reply she needs.

549
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:18,425
She won't even turn to look at me again.

550
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:20,200
As if she was going to, anyhow.

551
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,149
No need to give her a 'reply'.

552
00:38:23,149 --> 00:38:25,973
Shatter her dreams quietly.

553
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,935
Don't slam it into the ground, roaring,

554
00:38:27,935 --> 00:38:30,817
'I've shattered them'!

555
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:32,922
Why not just say no to her?

556
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:36,210
Tell her

557
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,904
That she's only got wanton rampage waiting for her.

558
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:42,544
Anyway, who's she?

559
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:47,900
Don't tell me her name, just where she's from.

560
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:53,966
Not far away.

561
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:58,086
In fact, this city itself.

562
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:00,465
She must be beautiful.

563
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,385
Very.

564
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,050
Fairy-like.

565
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:10,779
She's happy with you?

566
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:13,152
Why not?

567
00:39:13,531 --> 00:39:15,371
I'm sure she knows that you

568
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:18,151
Smoke weed, gamble,

569
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:22,237
And read out her letters to friends?

570
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,631
There!

571
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:28,078
You're my sister for just a few moments,

572
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:31,415
Until Dad starts speaking from your mouth.

573
00:39:31,415 --> 00:39:33,726
You, too, should remember, Afzal,

574
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:36,954
You're Reverend Subhanallah's son.

575
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,498
Go to sleep early.

576
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:41,900
Dad wants to see you before noon.

577
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
