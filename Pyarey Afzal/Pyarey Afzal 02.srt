00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:46,493
You're my sister for just a few moments,

8
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:49,806
Until Dad starts speaking from your mouth.

9
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,137
You, too, should remember, Afzal,

10
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:55,366
You're Reverend Subhanallah's son.

11
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,912
Go to sleep early.

12
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:59,768
Dad wants to see you before noon.

13
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,703
And don't you dare raise your voice.

14
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:05,808
Better stay quiet than lie.

15
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:11,971
He's even worried that you may have to suffer for your lies.

16
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,300
Take the cup.

17
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,897
What are you doing?

18
00:03:31,897 --> 00:03:33,921
I won't let go.

19
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,451
What's the big deal now?

20
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:36,872
Can't I hold your hand?

21
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:38,567
Let go!

22
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:40,754
I'm getting angry!

23
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,839
I don't fear your fury.

24
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:45,903
And I never will after 15th December.

25
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:48,437
Let go! What if someone saw --

26
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,433
So what?

27
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:52,906
They'll just think of it as our expression of love.

28
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:55,106
No, it's not that.

29
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,545
Let's meet tonight?

30
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:57,505
Tonight?

31
00:03:57,505 --> 00:04:00,485
Hush! The walls have ears!

32
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:02,809
On the terrace?

33
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,834
Yes.

34
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,874
Let go now!

35
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,553
When?

36
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,753
9 o'clock!

37
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,149
Why not 8?

38
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:16,108
D -- Dad watches the news at 9.

39
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,344
Oh...

40
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,470
Promise?

41
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:21,454
Tell me.

42
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:22,923
Promise?

43
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:24,618
You'll be there, won't you?

44
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:25,728
Oh,

45
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,106
I'd be there at 8.30.

46
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:29,314
Ohhh...

47
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:31,084
When will the night fall,

48
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:34,016
And when will it finally be 9...

49
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,302
Come here.

50
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:52,565
I was listening tales of her childhood shenanigans.

51
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:53,758
God forgive.

52
00:04:53,758 --> 00:04:55,979
She used to hold the dog by his ears!

53
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,259
Hey!

54
00:04:57,721 --> 00:04:59,713
I never knew there were such dogs --

55
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:00,642
I mean --

56
00:05:00,642 --> 00:05:02,649
The kind that'd let you hold them by the ear?

57
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:05,148
She's talking about puppies.

58
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,530
Oh.

59
00:05:08,326 --> 00:05:09,623
Thank you.

60
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:17,634
Mum, we're not leaving this evening.

61
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,340
Why?

62
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:23,221
I've got to meet someone at 9.

63
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:26,097
Here in Hydarabad? Who?

64
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:29,265
One of my friends, Mum -- You know...

65
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:31,733
It's okay if he has plans.

66
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:33,509
You can leave tomorrow morning.

67
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:35,842
Yes Mum, we'll leave tomorrow.

68
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:38,266
Is she still asleep?

69
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,814
No, she's just a bit coy.

70
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:57,495
Hold it right there.

71
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:58,915
Do you know

72
00:05:58,915 --> 00:06:01,398
He's told everyone about the meeting tonight.

73
00:06:01,398 --> 00:06:02,820
What?

74
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,075
Yes.

75
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:08,489
Said before Dad he's got to meet someone tonight at 9.

76
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:09,973
The blighter!

77
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,223
Don't call him a blighter like that.

78
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:13,996
He didn't tell the who!

79
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:16,066
I'm calling him a blighter because

80
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,646
He grabbed my hand in the morning

81
00:06:18,646 --> 00:06:21,146
And refused to let go.

82
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,759
Stop laughing.

83
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,181
I felt I should hold the meeting right at that moment,

84
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,605
Bring him to the terrace and drop the bombshell on him.

85
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:29,599
Please don't do that.

86
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,411
Break hearts, sure, but elegantly.

87
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:33,474
Piece by piece,

88
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:34,926
Slowly,

89
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:35,915
One subtle blow,

90
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:37,489
Then another.

91
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:38,555
By the way,

92
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:41,044
Science hasn't verified something like 'broken hearts'.

93
00:06:41,044 --> 00:06:44,922
For now, let's just say it can shatter like glass!

94
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:48,524
I'll verify your claim scientifically!

95
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:50,358
Sweet Jesus!

96
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:53,956
At first, he looked like a real gentleman.

97
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,706
Now, he seems neither gentle nor a man!

98
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:01,743
Mind your anger until 9 p.m.

99
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:05,911
Or Mum will think you're about to wage a war!

100
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:10,241
Peace be upon you.
-And upon you too.

101
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,969
Don't bring me to the market, Reverend...

102
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,551
He'll find out.

103
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,931
I swear, he'll kill me.

104
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:20,310
Do not fear anyone if you're doing the right thing.

105
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,092
I'm right here.

106
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:25,036
I won't let anyone touch you.

107
00:07:25,106 --> 00:07:26,403
And upon you, peace.

108
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,446
So what do I have to do?

109
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,507
Come with me to him.

110
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:33,586
And say without fear what he's done.

111
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:35,334
Before him?

112
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,463
To his face.

113
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,450
And

114
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,216
Those letters you used to listen to

115
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:44,581
Do you remember

116
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:47,640
Any of what she used to write?

117
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,186
Most of the times, just...

118
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:52,131
'I'll die without you'.

119
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,981
God forgive!

120
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:56,191
Where does she live?

121
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,119
In this city, apparently.

122
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:00,238
Because he only has her letters.

123
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:02,339
No envelopes.

124
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:05,427
So she lives nearby...

125
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:07,004
Yes...

126
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:09,987
May I go now, Reverend?

127
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,534
Didn't I tell you to go to him,

128
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,164
And present every piece of evidence?

129
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,603
No, Reverend.

130
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:20,603
If I saw him -- I'd deny everything -- I'd swear --

131
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:22,977
That I never said anything!

132
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:26,111
God curses the liars!

133
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,374
Where are you off to now?

134
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,423
If you believe what I said, okay --

135
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,572
Or just think I lied to you...

136
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:33,763
He doesn't gamble,

137
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:34,800
Doesn't smoke weed --

138
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,484
There's no letters --

139
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:37,396
Hey --

140
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,455
Listen to me!

141
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,017
The boorish --

142
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,940
And upon you, peace.

143
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,780
May you live long.

144
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,205
I can guess about the local matches.

145
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:52,016
But who told him about the India-Pakistan match?

146
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:54,689
And -- to the devil with the matches!

147
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:56,712
He even knows about the letters!

148
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:59,015
How can it be?

149
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:01,129
MUst've been Sir Timmy!

150
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:03,336
He knows everything.

151
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:05,221
He didn't name my friends,

152
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,519
But he mentioned everything.

153
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,745
'Reads out her letters to his friends'!

154
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,738
You're doubting me?

155
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,184
You're talking about doubt?

156
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,997
My friendship is at stake.

157
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,033
Eladio!

158
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,216
Don't talk about Eladio.

159
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,758
The lad's a selfless servant.

160
00:09:21,758 --> 00:09:23,489
You're accusing him because he's poor?

161
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:25,578
Must've been Sajid.

162
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,744
No --

163
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:28,617
Why would he?

164
00:09:28,897 --> 00:09:30,533
Alright, I'll talk later.

165
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:32,448
Dad's here.

166
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,969
The meeting's about to start.

167
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:40,796
Peace be upon you.

168
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:43,364
And upon you, peace.

169
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:51,540
Talk as a father.

170
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,089
Not a Reverend.

171
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,968
Call him.

172
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,190
Call him here.

173
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:28,889
Would you like some water?

174
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:32,725
I said call him here.

175
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:36,816
He's coming in a few minutes. He's afraid.

176
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:40,230
Strange.

177
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,715
He's fearing me

178
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:45,929
And I him...

179
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,655
Tell him to come.

180
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:51,018
I've come without evidence.

181
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,678
I'll talk differently.

182
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,085
Peace be upon you, Dad.

183
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:03,667
And upon you, peace.

184
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:06,248
Come.

185
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,805
Sit.

186
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:14,576
You may leave.

187
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:19,873
Shut the door.

188
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:33,439
Arifa says you were fearing me.

189
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,360
Happy to hear.

190
00:11:37,494 --> 00:11:39,779
Why were you fearing me?

191
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,416
It's nothing like that.

192
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,261
Yesterday, you mentioned gambling --

193
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:45,890
Weed --

194
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,592
I was ashamed of myself.

195
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:50,130
I was afraid

196
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,179
About what I'd say to you...

197
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:59,485
You forgot the one about her letters...

198
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,107
Anyway.

199
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:05,165
That chapter has closed by itself.

200
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:09,474
I found no evidence of any of it.

201
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:14,894
The poor devil who'd informed me

202
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:18,632
Didn't agree to testify.

203
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:24,165
The poor soul ran away, frightened of you.

204
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:31,970
You're henceforth acquitted of all three accusations.

205
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,710
So rejoice.

206
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:40,576
You're - God be praised - acquitted

207
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:45,708
I've got to answer for my crimes.

208
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,365
My Mum's no more,

209
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:51,798
Else I would've been acquitted too.

210
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:53,546
What have you done, Dad?

211
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:56,439
I'm guilty of

212
00:12:56,439 --> 00:13:02,493
Raising my dear child by rightful means.

213
00:13:02,493 --> 00:13:05,554
There's another crime.

214
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:10,001
You've achieved renown in the neighbourhood,

215
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:14,855
And I'm helpless before you.

216
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:19,764
And thus I've decided to spend the rest of my days

217
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:23,184
In the seclusion of the Mosque.

218
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:24,910
No Dad...

219
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,917
Not in seclusion.

220
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,064
You'll stay at home.

221
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:31,972
I cannot stay here.

222
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:33,300
Why not?

223
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,527
Because <i>you</i>'re here.

224
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:42,985
And because of you, I fear what fate awaits me.

225
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:46,960
Ruqaiyya!

226
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,870
Ruqaiyya!

227
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,670
Stop leaning against the door and come inside.

228
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,234
Listen to me.

229
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,926
Bless you.

230
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:16,078
I have failed to find evidence against your son.

231
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:19,354
I am ashamed of myself

232
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:25,922
And therefore leaving this house for the seclusion of the Mosque.

233
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:30,509
Pack the essentials and give me leave.

234
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:33,503
What are you talking about, Reverend?

235
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:35,971
Didn't you say,

236
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:38,149
'Talk as a father'?

237
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,928
Now bear witness,

238
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:44,189
That I talked as a father.

239
00:14:44,189 --> 00:14:50,644
I'm exiling the Reverend to the seclusion of the Mosque.

240
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,490
Go!

241
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,242
Fall at his feet!

242
00:14:55,242 --> 00:15:00,101
Apologise with your head at his feet!

243
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,087
Dad!

244
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,145
Forgive me for all my sins!

245
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:07,146
For God's sake, forgive me!

246
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,030
Right.

247
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,010
First, offer your noon prayers.

248
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,070
We'll talk later.

249
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:51,041
See?

250
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,545
He hasn't forgiven you completely.

251
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:55,634
But he will.

252
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,668
Purify yourself

253
00:15:57,668 --> 00:16:00,202
And stand in the foremost rank.

254
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:03,170
That's what he's hinted at!

255
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,550
Go!

256
00:16:28,332 --> 00:16:29,969
It's you!

257
00:16:31,392 --> 00:16:32,979
Headed for the Mosque?

258
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:33,987
Yes.

259
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,731
When did this happen?

260
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:36,830
Today.

261
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,621
Dad said, offer your prayers, or else --

262
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:39,510
Or else?

263
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,809
I -- I'm getting late.

264
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,142
You're out on the streets,

265
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:48,524
Don't laugh like that.

266
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,563
That bloke...

267
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:52,632
He's a ruffian.

268
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:53,935
No --

269
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,910
He's gone to pray.

270
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,727
Don't turn to look back.

271
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,442
It isn't proper!

272
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:02,909
Blimey, Aunt!

273
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,575
He's my best friend's brother.

274
00:17:04,575 --> 00:17:06,924
Reverend Subhanallah's son.

275
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,378
You don't know,

276
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,572
But Eladio tells me everything.

277
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,259
He's with those yobs,

278
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:14,628
Gambling --

279
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:16,778
And who knows what else!

280
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:18,232
Alright,

281
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:21,412
But he's going to pray now.

282
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:41,563
Peace and Mercy of God upon you.

283
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:47,911
Peace and Mercy of God upon you.

284
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,310
There is no God but the Almighty.

285
00:17:57,114 --> 00:18:00,744
Hear me, O Lord...

286
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,916
I begin in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

287
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,500
You are Peace, and from You is Peace.

288
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,196
Amen!

289
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:15,114
Give us our lives in Your surrender, and admit into the Safety of Your Peace.

290
00:18:15,114 --> 00:18:18,213
You are the Most Praised, the Most Sublime.

291
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,923
The Lord of Majesty and Bounty.

292
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:30,450
And blessings of God be upon Mohammad and his companions.

293
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,985
And hit him so hard,

294
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,832
He gets cold feet the moment he sees her!

295
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:46,135
she must've hit him on the feet!

296
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,320
Come in.

297
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:29,321
Are the dresses ready, or will they be tomorrow?

298
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,170
What are you doing? Get your hands off!

299
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:39,176
What was that?

300
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,323
Just kidding.

301
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:45,670
Get used to it. After our marriage...

302
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,727
Why did you come in my room?

303
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:51,059
You said, 'Come in'.

304
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:52,596
Oh God.

305
00:19:52,596 --> 00:19:53,753
Get out.

306
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:55,141
Out!

307
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:56,866
This isn't right.

308
00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:59,477
You get angry every now and then.

309
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:00,650
And I --

310
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,156
I've been waiting for 9 p.m. since the morning.

311
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,337
Nothing can change our plan for 9 p.m.

312
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,209
I swear.

313
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:11,659
I won't be a minute late.

314
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:14,069
I was getting bored alone

315
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:18,381
And thought if a little meeting before the night --

316
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:21,738
Hey!

317
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:24,223
Splendid!

318
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:28,076
Nothing so splendid.

319
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,073
I'm leaving.

320
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,055
Chap sneaked into the room.

321
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:40,995
I thought it was you.

322
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:42,410
Anyway.

323
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,453
Are the dresses ready or will they be 'tomorrow'?

324
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,266
Not tomorrow, the day after.

325
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:50,079
He said he was cutting vegetables with his wife when he cut his hand.

326
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,717
Splendid!

327
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:06,748
What?

328
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:07,716
Nothing.

329
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,733
I said nothing.

330
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,260
Come.

331
00:21:22,697 --> 00:21:24,203
Here.

332
00:21:24,248 --> 00:21:26,051
Dad --

333
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,193
Why have you brought me here?

334
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:30,200
I swear that thing about the letters is false.

335
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,156
I swear by you!

336
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:35,078
Who said anything about any letters?

337
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:37,979
I've talked to Monseigneur.

338
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:41,379
Saw him praying and told him about you.

339
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:44,906
When he heard you'd done a BA, he said, 'Bring him to me'.

340
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,359
'I'll give him a job'.

341
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,592
Come. Come here.

342
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,560
Come here.

343
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:23,971
Tell me, how big is your heart?

344
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:26,480
See for yourself.

345
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,573
The fact is,

346
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,030
I'm afraid.

347
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,577
Afraid of being dishonoured...

348
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,014
We're the kind who'd die for honour.

349
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:35,830
The times have changed.

350
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,348
People compromise on honour a little.

351
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,769
Perhaps.

352
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:45,817
But why are we talking about it?

353
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,486
Let's talk about something else.

354
00:23:47,486 --> 00:23:48,596
Right --

355
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:51,068
What did I start on --

356
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:55,305
I think we have an understanding.

357
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:56,994
Should I say it?

358
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:58,412
What?

359
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:01,306
Please don't be disturbed to hear it.

360
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:05,051
I won't. Promise.

361
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:07,292
It's bad.

362
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:09,134
But best told.

363
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:12,112
If such things come out in the open after the marriage,

364
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:14,429
Even lovers get divorced.

365
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,403
God forgive!

366
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,744
Place your hand over your heart.

367
00:24:18,744 --> 00:24:20,744
Do it!

368
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:27,474
The thing is

369
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:31,236
I love someone else, Mehtab.

370
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,984
Since childhood...

371
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:36,339
He was a classmate.

372
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:38,793
We used to write letters everyday,

373
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:41,695
And now, we talk for hours over the phone.

374
00:24:41,695 --> 00:24:45,337
He'd say, 'I'll die without you'.

375
00:24:45,337 --> 00:24:46,617
And

376
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:50,115
Before the date was fixed, I'd say the same.

377
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:51,647
But now, I guess

378
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:55,503
I have to sacrifice my first love for Dad's sake.

379
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:59,422
You must be feeling very bad,

380
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:00,875
But --
-No.

381
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,367
I don't feel bad at all.

382
00:25:03,717 --> 00:25:05,793
I'm chuffed to see

383
00:25:05,793 --> 00:25:10,385
That you didn't conceal your past like other girls.

384
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:14,646
You've got courage.

385
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,240
Said it all to my face!

386
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:19,592
I swear by you,

387
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:22,114
I admire you even more now.

388
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:24,298
I'm proud of you.

389
00:25:25,356 --> 00:25:27,575
Everything about honour aside,

390
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:31,168
Your past is none of my concern.

391
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:34,741
Was this the compromise you were talking about?

392
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:03,233
Hey -- Wait -- Wha -- Ruined the sleeve there!

393
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,996
Look, Mum! My sharp dressed brother!

394
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:07,245
God bless!

395
00:26:07,245 --> 00:26:09,371
Ward the evil eye off him!

396
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,420
Do I look good?

397
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,546
Sightly, I swear!

398
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:15,365
It's 'as God has willed'!

399
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,608
Ward the evil eye off him.

400
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:23,510
Do anything you want; many eyes will be fixed on him today!

401
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,742
Look at him, Dad!

402
00:26:30,135 --> 00:26:32,352
I am looking.

403
00:26:32,352 --> 00:26:35,630
This is how gentlemen look. Just perfect!

404
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,739
Right. Turn away.

405
00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:43,236
Don't stay before my eyes too long like this.

406
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,297
Have him walk under the Holy Qur'an when he leaves.

407
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:51,092
It's his first day at the office.

408
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:52,667
And

409
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:56,601
The bloke looks sightly indeed!

410
00:26:56,601 --> 00:26:59,290
Don't look back if a sweetheart looks at you.

411
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,942
These looks could kill!

412
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:04,487
The Lord is happy with me,

413
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:06,489
Or perhaps

414
00:27:06,489 --> 00:27:09,873
With you, Ruqaiyya.

415
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:12,165
To be honest, Dad

416
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,306
He is happy with me.

417
00:27:14,306 --> 00:27:16,869
I'd prayed with tears in my eyes that noon.

418
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,646
Like this.

419
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,290
With my hands folded

420
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,491
Saying,

421
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:26,738
'If the meeting does not bring good news, I'll be found making up for missed prayers'.

422
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:28,851
God forgive you!

423
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,403
Threatened God?

424
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:33,197
How's this a threat?

425
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:37,369
Is it a threat if I'm angry with you and say I won't eat?

426
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:40,208
It's a threat when I don't do something for <i>you</i>.

427
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:42,036
Which I do without failure.

428
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,972
Yours, and His.

429
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:46,549
Alright, don't list your favours.

430
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:49,967
And don't reason in ignorance.

431
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:53,571
And you just have a jolly time standing.

432
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:57,971
Pack him some egg bread for lunch.

433
00:27:57,971 --> 00:27:59,141
Okay.

434
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:02,641
He'll be there until five!

435
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,250
Come.

436
00:28:20,504 --> 00:28:21,673
Go.

437
00:28:21,673 --> 00:28:24,157
Keep the bag in the car.

438
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,609
Hey!

439
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:30,766
Where are you going?

440
00:28:32,747 --> 00:28:35,467
You said she's not coming to see me off.

441
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:36,659
Obviously.

442
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,436
How can she come to see you off with Dad standing there?

443
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:41,044
That's why I was going upstairs.

444
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:43,867
She might be crying.

445
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,520
What?

446
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:47,520
It's just that

447
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,644
Goodbyes

448
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:52,617
Can be fatal for lovers.

449
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:56,756
And this restriction on seeing me off!

450
00:28:56,834 --> 00:29:00,490
How she must be feeling!

451
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:04,260
Aunt's in the car and Mum and Dad are waiting for you.

452
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,398
What's she doing?

453
00:29:07,193 --> 00:29:08,223
Anyway.

454
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:10,177
I needn't ask that...

455
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:12,880
She must be distressed.

456
00:29:14,327 --> 00:29:16,579
Don't look up.

457
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:19,465
Dad often finds excuses to check.

458
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:20,774
Sorry, but

459
00:29:20,774 --> 00:29:24,121
It's 2013 and he's stuck in 1913.

460
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:25,568
But anyway,

461
00:29:25,568 --> 00:29:28,570
Tell her it'll be this way after our marriage too.

462
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,240
Will she trouble herself weeping and wailing like this?

463
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,082
I may even have to go somewhere for a week or so.

464
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:37,297
I'll tell her.

465
00:29:39,318 --> 00:29:42,565
And tell her it's just four months until December.

466
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:43,987
Here I go,

467
00:29:43,987 --> 00:29:45,988
And there comes December.

468
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:47,784
If the Lord wills...

469
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,350
Alright.

470
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,248
One more thing.

471
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:59,295
A secret.

472
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:01,676
Tell her

473
00:30:01,676 --> 00:30:05,800
Not to call the wrong people.

474
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,770
What do you mean?

475
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:11,509
I can't tell you the whole thing.

476
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,972
Just tell her indirectly

477
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:17,473
To let bygones be bygones.

478
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,811
Stop!

479
00:30:30,326 --> 00:30:31,572
Wait.

480
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:32,980
Yes.

481
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,313
Now, begin in the name of God,

482
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:38,390
Bow your head, and walk on.

483
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:40,966
Wait a second!

484
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:43,853
You left your lunch box here.

485
00:30:44,132 --> 00:30:45,239
Dad!

486
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:49,317
He said the tie and the lunch box didn't match well enough.

487
00:30:49,317 --> 00:30:50,816
Won't leave a good impression.

488
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,833
One who submits to God

489
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:57,781
Leaves an impression with his humility, my dear.

490
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:00,808
He's humble, Reverend.

491
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:02,697
He's doing his duty.

492
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:07,138
Will he be humble only if he has his lunch box?

493
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,930
Go, my child.

494
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,446
In the name of God.

495
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:11,931
Go.

496
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:18,034
O Lord, the Most Exalted.

497
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:24,250
Oh!

498
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,164
I was so overjoyed I forgot to ask you... What's his rank?

499
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:31,443
And how much will he earn?

500
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:33,489
He's a clerk,

501
00:31:33,489 --> 00:31:36,466
And he'll earn 10,000.

502
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:38,498
That's it?

503
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,538
You made him a clerk...

504
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:47,000
With a third division all the way from matric [GCSEs] to BA,

505
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,813
Monseigneur has been generous enough

506
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:53,809
To not ask about his experience,

507
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,571
Else I would've said,

508
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:58,258
He's a proper gambler.

509
00:31:58,258 --> 00:32:02,420
And he, too, can see through a man so well

510
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,087
As to have him in the accounts department!

511
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:07,788
God is great indeed!

512
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:12,212
If the noon prayer had its effect,

513
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:14,038
He will prosper,

514
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,315
Or else it'll be another albatross around my neck.

515
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:20,233
My neck

516
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:24,983
And his tie make <i>quite</i> the combination!

517
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:34,780
It's only four months until December.

518
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,605
They shall pass.

519
00:32:37,605 --> 00:32:39,746
My foot!

520
00:32:41,123 --> 00:32:43,485
Don't trouble yourself weeping and wailing.

521
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:45,200
What?

522
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:51,467
Farah Mehtab sounds so good!

523
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:54,604
And you sound so bad!

524
00:32:56,337 --> 00:32:57,977
You can have it in writing.

525
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,787
The December shall never come

526
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:02,894
When Farah Ibrahim will get married to Mehtab Chawla.

527
00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:06,856
Or so it can be said that 2013 will end with 11 months.

528
00:33:06,856 --> 00:33:11,280
For the first time, there will be no December in a year!

529
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:13,945
Bye!

530
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:18,009
Hey, Afzal!

531
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,368
Complete with trews, shirt and a tie!

532
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:22,645
Who decked you up?

533
00:33:22,645 --> 00:33:24,331
What do you mean?

534
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:26,023
I deck myself up.

535
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,475
You're going on a date!

536
00:33:27,475 --> 00:33:28,878
I'm going to office.

537
00:33:28,878 --> 00:33:30,048
Office?

538
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:32,116
You know Sheikh Ibrahim Cotton Mills?

539
00:33:32,116 --> 00:33:34,424
I'm the Accounts Officer.

540
00:33:34,424 --> 00:33:36,073
Monseigneur Ibrahim?

541
00:33:36,073 --> 00:33:37,873
Forget <i>him</i>.

542
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:39,885
I'm an officer!

543
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:44,186
What a spunky lassie he's got --

544
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:47,248
Who are you talking about?

545
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:49,753
Don't show your depravity!

546
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:55,006
Think of people's daughters as your sisters.

547
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:53,211
Third division in matric [GCSEs],

548
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,303
Third division in inter [A-Levels],

549
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,440
Third division in BA,

550
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,612
And what's your name?

551
00:34:59,612 --> 00:35:01,411
Afzal [The Excellent One] Subhanallah.

552
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:06,569
Subhanallah Afzal [The Splendid Afzal] suits you better.

553
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:08,839
Subhanallah is my father's name.

554
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:11,565
Experience?

555
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:14,126
Zero.

556
00:35:15,842 --> 00:35:17,871
No third division here, eh?

557
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:21,183
I haven't started work that would gain me experience.

558
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:23,434
Why has Monseigneur appointed you?

559
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:25,208
On my father's recommendation.

560
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,629
Who is your father?

561
00:35:26,629 --> 00:35:28,532
He's a priest at the Mosque.

562
00:35:28,532 --> 00:35:30,331
He leads Monseigneur's prayers.

563
00:35:30,331 --> 00:35:31,925
Oh...

564
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,235
Miss Rosy!

565
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:39,104
Yes?

566
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:41,793
Meet Mr Subhanallah Afzal.

567
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,787
Take him to his desk,

568
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:46,773
And show him how to fill a voucher.

569
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:49,886
Just filling vouchers?

570
00:35:49,886 --> 00:35:52,618
Teach him whatever he can learn.

571
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:55,873
Alright.

572
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:56,672
Come.

573
00:35:56,672 --> 00:35:58,142
Go.

574
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,840
Sit.

575
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,000
Come a bit closer to me.

576
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:08,114
Yes?

577
00:36:08,114 --> 00:36:14,254
I said come a bit closer, so that I can show you how to fill a voucher.

578
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,620
Alright.

579
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:28,349
Mr Chengezi was insulting you so bad.

580
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:30,680
Didn't you feel angry?

581
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,619
A bit.

582
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,683
But you were smiling.

583
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:38,929
Do you know why?

584
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:41,037
Why?

585
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:45,084
One day, I will insult him.

586
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:53,347
Back to work now.

587
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,696
Who is it?

588
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,473
Lubna!
-How are you?

589
00:37:01,473 --> 00:37:05,813
Come in.
-Take this; come back after an hour.

590
00:37:06,463 --> 00:37:09,118
If it isn't our sweet Lubna!

591
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:10,225
Peace be upon you, Aunt.

592
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,804
And upon you, peace.

593
00:37:11,804 --> 00:37:12,868
How are you?

594
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:14,867
How many months has it been?

595
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,491
I've brought sweets for you.

596
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:18,068
Sweets? Why?

597
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,771
Someone's getting married!

598
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,535
Yes.
-Isn't it?

599
00:37:21,535 --> 00:37:23,191
Getting married?

600
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,630
You're so shameless!

601
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,251
You're telling us when you bring us sweets?

602
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:27,314
Who's the man?

603
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:30,064
First, ask who's getting married!

604
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:31,617
Farah?

605
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,299
Yes.

606
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,885
Thank goodness she's found someone.

607
00:37:36,885 --> 00:37:38,569
Sit down and talk,

608
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:41,241
I'll get some tea.

609
00:37:44,485 --> 00:37:47,390
First have some sweets,

610
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,624
Then I'll tell you the bitter reality.

611
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:51,169
I've had sweets, now tell me!

612
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,217
Easy, girl!

613
00:37:52,217 --> 00:37:54,150
Let the sweets sink in!

614
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,211
Let's go inside.

615
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,525
Now, fill this voucher.

616
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:07,127
Say, Ibrahim Cottons sold cloth worth 1,000,000

617
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:10,094
And the buyer gave a cheque of 1,000,000.

618
00:38:10,094 --> 00:38:12,790
This white one's the debit voucher.

619
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,291
It's written on it,

620
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,795
But because of the white colour,

621
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,008
It can be seen

622
00:38:18,008 --> 00:38:19,509
Rather easily.

623
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:22,437
The bank is the debit and sales are the credit.

624
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:23,271
Now

625
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:26,143
Fill a debit voucher.

626
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,110
Fill it.

627
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,840
Are you married?

628
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:53,415
You didn't mention this --

629
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,190
I'm asking you.

630
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,584
Tell me if you're married.

631
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,332
No.

632
00:39:00,332 --> 00:39:02,426
Not yet.

633
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:06,738
Then, there's a lot more I can teach you.

634
00:39:09,707 --> 00:39:11,499
Don't answer the phone.

635
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,532
Mr Chengezi minds it.

636
00:39:13,532 --> 00:39:17,197
And he can't stand personal calls at all.

637
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:21,284
What does he do when he can't stand something?

638
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,025
Aye, Babloo?

639
00:39:23,025 --> 00:39:24,385
7 p.m. sharp.

640
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:25,477
What is it?

641
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:27,556
A match against the old colony lads.

642
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:29,415
Floodlight.

643
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,080
Why are you laughing?

644
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:34,813
I can't play.

645
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:36,701
Can't play?

646
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:38,265
What's this guff?

647
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:39,826
I've put 50,000 on the line.

648
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:42,134
10,000 for you if we win.

649
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:43,543
Shut up!

650
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:45,653
No more matches now.

651
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:47,416
I've started working now.

652
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:48,755
I'm on duty.

653
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:50,601
Want more cash, eh, bugger?

654
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,443
Alright,

655
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:52,505
15,000 for you.

656
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:55,380
That okay?
-I won't even agree to 20.

657
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,552
Enough for now. Bye!

658
00:40:00,636 --> 00:40:02,946
It --

659
00:40:02,946 --> 00:40:04,464
Was a friend.

660
00:40:04,464 --> 00:40:05,587
A punter.

661
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:07,179
Gambles on matches.

662
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,632
That's the last call you answered in this office!

663
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:10,835
No, sir.

664
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,609
That was the first.

665
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:14,330
Miss Rosy, tell him!

666
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:20,191
Tell him how to behave in the office before teaching him how to fill vouchers!

667
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,690
I'd warned you.

668
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,992
Didn't you see him

669
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:27,934
Crawl back?

670
00:40:27,934 --> 00:40:29,829
The crab.

671
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
