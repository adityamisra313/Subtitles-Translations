Splendid.

8
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:48,999
So to speak, she's getting married, and also not!

9
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,853
It's a marriage for one and not for the other.

10
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:54,265
Does she actually love someone else?

11
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:55,177
No.

12
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:58,401
She was lying about the letters and the calls.

13
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,725
What do you mean?

14
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:02,122
She just lied casually.

15
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,465
God forgive!

16
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,211
Ask why!

17
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:07,761
Why?
-To raise an issue of honour.

18
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,489
Well, that does it...

19
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:10,630
Not really.

20
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,866
He was delighted to hear it.

21
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,318
He said,

22
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,343
'I admire you even more now'.

23
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:17,812
'I'm proud of you'.

24
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:22,340
'You didn't conceal your past like other girls'.

25
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:26,673
So that's why the date's been fixed.

26
00:02:26,673 --> 00:02:27,787
Yes.

27
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:30,672
But how can she turn back now?

28
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,755
You don't know her.

29
00:02:32,755 --> 00:02:33,747
I do.

30
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:36,555
When she said she'd embitter us with these sweets,

31
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,176
She must mean it!

32
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:39,011
But

33
00:02:39,011 --> 00:02:41,638
It's only four months until December.

34
00:02:41,638 --> 00:02:43,441
And when I said this,

35
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:45,882
She said that this year will have 11 months,

36
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:48,846
And end without a December.

37
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:52,392
Mum!

38
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,314
Keep the door open

39
00:02:55,314 --> 00:02:58,567
So I can hear your laughter downstairs.

40
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,016
Where's your brother, the loafer?

41
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,157
Have some shame.

42
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,917
Would you still call him a loafer?

43
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:10,477
What is it this time?

44
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:13,396
As if you don't know a thing!

45
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:15,264
I swear by you, I don't.

46
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,807
He hasn't passed away, has he?

47
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:18,209
He's got a job!

48
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,518
That's great!

49
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:24,541
You don't know, your father has hired him in accounts at the mill.

50
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:25,624
Oh?

51
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,482
He left wearing a tie,

52
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:29,214
A fine, sharp dressed gentleman!

53
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:32,040
I swear, he looked fabulous!

54
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,894
Sometimes, I feel he should've been born in a family like yours.

55
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,671
He'd wear dazzling suits,

56
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:39,138
Shining boots,

57
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,332
A hundred kinds of ties...

58
00:03:41,332 --> 00:03:43,106
Ride a luxury car,

59
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:44,526
Attend royal parties near and far,

60
00:03:44,526 --> 00:03:46,010
And have a ball.

61
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,079
But anyway,

62
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,160
Thank God

63
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,579
He's got a job today,

64
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,030
He'll prosper.

65
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,979
We'll have a car too,

66
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,877
Then I'll talk to you.

67
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:56,342
Talk -- what?

68
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:58,367
I mean, show it off, dear!

69
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,757
We'll meet,

70
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:01,688
'Round the lane with the Mosque,

71
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:03,940
Your car from there, ours from here,

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,344
I'd blow the horn and say,

73
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,344
'Move aside, mate'!

74
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:09,960
Surely, you --

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,689
Don't mind?

76
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,018
Not at all.

77
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:16,725
Dad used to be a supervisor in a cotton mill.

78
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:19,451
He travelled seven miles on a bicycle.

79
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:21,565
He'll find prosperity too, one day.

80
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:24,617
Cars, mansions - he'll get all he wants.

81
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:26,917
But tell him

82
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,740
To mind his character.

83
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,633
Prosperity won't be far that way.

84
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:34,632
And

85
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:37,041
Here comes my security detail.

86
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:43,529
I'll take my leave.

87
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,470
Bye!

88
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,840
Yes, Babloo?

89
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,157
Take it for 20.

90
00:05:03,157 --> 00:05:04,413
20?

91
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,341
Not a penny more.

92
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:07,607
Look, Babloo.

93
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,711
I'm not the old Afzal anymore.

94
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,116
I've got a job.

95
00:05:11,116 --> 00:05:15,006
One where I can't answer calls!

96
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:22,403
Look ahead!

97
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:24,151
What's before me?

98
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:28,495
My boss, Mr Chengezi, is staring at me with his eyes ablaze.

99
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,271
He face doesn't redden with rage,

100
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,664
It blackens.

101
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,854
Look, Babloo.

102
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,257
Forget me.

103
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:37,527
I'm getting used to living on my salary.

104
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:38,499
You and --

105
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,954
Don't use a four letter word!

106
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,305
I can't say one back!

107
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,801
Because

108
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:49,046
There's a sweet lady next to me.

109
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:52,754
Alright, bye.

110
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:53,727
You bugger!

111
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:55,924
You're the worst dastard.

112
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:58,174
Foul words!

113
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,020
Tell me

114
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,225
What'd you do before you became an accountant?

115
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,006
What else, sir?

116
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:09,662
Loafing around or

117
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,990
Bulldozing around.

118
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:14,011
But sir

119
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,911
I ain't that old Afzal.

120
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,059
If someone looked at me like that,

121
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:20,788
Like you are,

122
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:23,446
I swear by you, I would've clawed his eyes out.

123
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:25,549
But sir,

124
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:27,802
Boss is boss.

125
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,851
I've accepted you as mine.

126
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:36,618
Although in all honesty, you sometimes make me want to --

127
00:06:36,618 --> 00:06:38,453
What!?

128
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:40,489
Leave it, sir.

129
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,188
You should accept it too.

130
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm not the old Afzal.

131
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,895
What'll they think?

132
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,905
What?

133
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:38,501
So close since Day 1 that Rosy drove Afzal home?

134
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,539
Who cares?

135
00:07:40,772 --> 00:07:42,113
Honestly though,

136
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,221
Why this inconvenience?

137
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:46,384
My home isn't too far.

138
00:07:46,645 --> 00:07:49,057
For you, maybe...

139
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:52,565
Won't you be away if you go?

140
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:57,780
I think you're right.

141
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,668
But please,

142
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:01,584
Drop me at a slight distance.

143
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:04,390
At a distance?
-It's the neighbourhood.

144
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,890
Someone might think something wrong about you.

145
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,310
A man, yet so afraid!

146
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,162
I'm not a man...

147
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:14,399
W -- What?

148
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,377
I mean

149
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,378
I'm not afraid.

150
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:22,948
Women's honour is delicate.

151
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:26,070
I just care about that.

152
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,920
Straight ahead from here.

153
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,270
Excuse me.

154
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,762
Yes, Babloo?

155
00:08:37,762 --> 00:08:39,817
It's 6.15, you bugger.

156
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,084
Not again!

157
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,635
Doesn't 20 grand make your mouth water?

158
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,272
It does, old chap, but --

159
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:46,789
A word's a word.

160
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,799
I've given Dad my word.

161
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,998
Alright -- Let's seal it for 25.

162
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,590
25?

163
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,334
Turn around.

164
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,497
Turn around? Okay...

165
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,288
Mr 'Turn around'!

166
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,231
I'll give you 30.

167
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:02,702
And if you don't take it,

168
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,110
Bugger off!

169
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,090
Turn around again.

170
00:09:14,413 --> 00:09:15,496
Now,

171
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:16,639
Stop here.

172
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,139
Stop it, stop it!
-What?

173
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,397
Yes, I'm coming.

174
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:29,151
Leave me here, I'll get a rickshaw.

175
00:09:31,761 --> 00:09:33,043
Mum!

176
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:34,988
It's him - Afzal!

177
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,977
The loafer!

178
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:41,706
How'd he get a car?

179
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,470
A girl's sitting in the car; she's driving.

180
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,587
She might be injured or something...

181
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,335
Oh God...

182
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:50,357
Look at him!

183
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,430
He left her there!

184
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:28,968
Cap'n!

185
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,435
Afzal's here.

186
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:31,454
The bugger.

187
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:35,288
If he hadn't come now, there would've been no gambling left in the world.

188
00:10:35,288 --> 00:10:37,094
I like it.

189
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,147
What?

190
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:40,897
Dad can't possibly know if the match is outside the colony.

191
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:42,625
Don't drag your Dad into this.

192
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,204
You've got to win us this one.

193
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:45,873
Consider it done.

194
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:46,953
Modi,

195
00:10:46,953 --> 00:10:49,256
Get the stuff ready.

196
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,855
You saw Afzal with your own eyes?

197
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,571
Of course.

198
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,318
Saw him get out of the car and run away in a rickshaw!

199
00:11:02,318 --> 00:11:06,101
And you saw him with a girl?

200
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:07,691
You and your questions...

201
00:11:07,691 --> 00:11:10,611
<i>I</i> took her to the doctor.

202
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:12,992
Do you know who she is?

203
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,520
Who?

204
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,577
Works in the accounts department at our mill.

205
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:17,765
Rosy.

206
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:19,340
Rosy?

207
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,965
There go all the rosy hopes!

208
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:23,462
He won't change.

209
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:25,532
What's it to you?

210
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:27,555
He's my friend's brother.

211
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,980
Everyone's got his eyes on him.

212
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,404
The poor girl...

213
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:33,580
She's got dreams because of him.

214
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,528
I'd gone to give her sweets,

215
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,938
When she told me it's his first day at work.

216
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:40,504
He's got a job at our mill in accounts.

217
00:11:40,504 --> 00:11:41,618
Wow.

218
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,055
A job in accounts,

219
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,389
And a fiddle on his first day!

220
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,611
Fiddle?
-Isn't it?

221
00:11:47,611 --> 00:11:50,748
Got the accounts officer head over heels for him on the first day.

222
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:51,862
And you!

223
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:53,936
Why'd you give her sweets?

224
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:57,096
Won't sweets be distributed now that the date's been fixed?

225
00:11:57,096 --> 00:12:00,067
Mum asked me to go to the Reverend's first.

226
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,590
He'll give his blessings.

227
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,201
Oh God... Help me!

228
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,016
Splendid!

229
00:12:38,003 --> 00:12:39,518
You bugger!

230
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:41,947
Who'll score runs for us if you let them score so many?

231
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:44,089
Come to form.

232
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:45,851
Alright.

233
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:53,185
Easy there!

234
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,810
Yes!

235
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,792
Great!

236
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:40,697
Where'd he go on a rickshaw?

237
00:13:40,697 --> 00:13:42,240
What do I know?

238
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,530
He must've been headed home the way he ran.

239
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,718
He isn't here.

240
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:48,091
He's not even answering the phone.

241
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:49,327
Why would he?

242
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,555
He must have another one somewhere!

243
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:52,941
Another -- what?

244
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:54,639
Do <i>I</i> have to tell you?

245
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,664
Your love for God

246
00:13:56,664 --> 00:13:59,905
Has blinded you to His infinite mercy on your brother.

247
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,204
Wait.

248
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:02,827
I'll find out.

249
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,174
My maid's son Eladio...

250
00:14:05,174 --> 00:14:06,208
Yes?

251
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,830
He knows everything.

252
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,466
Alright, I'll wait.

253
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:11,664
Please ask him and tell me.

254
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:13,302
Okay, bye.

255
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,883
Hey...

256
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:07,260
Please win us this match.

257
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,564
I've borrowed 50,000 --
-How do I win this?

258
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:13,269
65 runs in 4 overs...

259
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:15,232
Do something.

260
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,530
Let me see...

261
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:51,192
Where is he?

262
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:55,478
Playing a match in the old colony.

263
00:15:55,478 --> 00:15:57,842
Gambling on it?

264
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,711
20 in 1 over...

265
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,913
It's all on you now.

266
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,426
Why me, you bugger?

267
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,342
Have I ever scored 20 in 1 over?

268
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:26,499
I swear...

269
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:27,661
Go for the sixes, Afzal.

270
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:29,020
That I will, Babloo...

271
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,995
I'll try my best.

272
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:32,219
You gotta do this for <i>her</i>.

273
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,653
Who?

274
00:16:33,653 --> 00:16:36,976
The one who writes you letters.

275
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:07,556
What was that, you bugger?

276
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,888
Don't you love her?

277
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,497
Look,

278
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,260
We need a six to win.

279
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,247
Please, mate.

280
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,226
Hit one.

281
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,770
Leave it be!

282
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,907
Right, show me the dough.

283
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,050
Yes.

284
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,536
Right here.

285
00:20:51,152 --> 00:20:53,345
Look, I've...

286
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:55,044
Found him.

287
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:57,436
I've brought him home.

288
00:20:57,672 --> 00:21:00,827
When I got there, the match

289
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:04,007
Was going on with vigour.

290
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:07,125
Ruqaiyya, I swear, if you had been by my side,

291
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,553
You would've sunk into the earth out of disgrace.

292
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:14,675
Labouring devotedly like an ox at an oil mill was our Afzal -

293
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:17,194
His guts haggard,

294
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:20,561
But resolve firm.

295
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:23,389
You kept on asking,

296
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,933
And she,

297
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,652
His sister, but empoisoned my ears,

298
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:28,935
That my son

299
00:21:28,935 --> 00:21:30,241
Gambles!

300
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:33,979
God forgive! God forgive!

301
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:38,238
You, blear-eyed,

302
00:21:38,238 --> 00:21:41,207
View pouring blood, toil, and sweat,

303
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:45,343
And striving for victory as gambling?

304
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,818
Look at him.

305
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:51,411
Here.

306
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,070
30,000 Rupees.

307
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,926
He's earned it.

308
00:21:57,926 --> 00:22:00,132
On every banknote,

309
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:05,845
You can see my Afzal's blood and sweat if only you'd look!

310
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:08,717
Step out of the house and see,

311
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:12,145
Look at your son's trials and tribulations!

312
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:14,913
Listen to his praise echo!

313
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,531
You'll realise, then,

314
00:22:16,531 --> 00:22:21,100
That our Afzal juggles two jobs at the same time.

315
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,949
Yes.

316
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:26,529
Hey!

317
00:22:26,854 --> 00:22:28,799
Why are you standing?

318
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,989
Sit down, son.

319
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:31,686
Sit down.

320
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:35,921
My son, you...

321
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:39,337
You're standing as if you've done something wrong.

322
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:42,504
I'm the one who's been wrong, son.

323
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:46,676
I listened to them and to God...

324
00:22:46,676 --> 00:22:49,566
Remained too busy with the Mosque and prayers...

325
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:53,967
And didn't shave off this sham piety and go with you.

326
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:56,051
Now, I will.

327
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:58,847
I will go with you now.

328
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:02,894
For the first time, someone else has given the call,

329
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:06,154
And I don't know

330
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:09,429
Who's led the prayers.

331
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,580
Enough of it all!

332
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,652
Enough of doing God's work.

333
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:20,661
My Afzal [excellent one] has outvied me!

334
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:23,795
He earns what he likes when he likes...

335
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:27,455
No obligations of five prayers in purity,

336
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:32,394
Nor the pain of bowing and obsecrating again and again.

337
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:35,704
I will go with you now.

338
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,139
Do you know how much

339
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:39,702
It hurt me

340
00:23:39,702 --> 00:23:44,579
When you, so openly, took your money?

341
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,901
Such overt and unashamed

342
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,937
Gambling is not proper.

343
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:54,314
Now, when I'll be with you,

344
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:55,179
There --

345
00:23:55,179 --> 00:23:57,495
Will be some secrecy.

346
00:23:57,495 --> 00:23:58,408
You

347
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:00,816
Can play your match, and

348
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:04,766
I will take the money.

349
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,060
Hey?

350
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:10,680
What are you looking at?

351
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,092
Get him something to eat.

352
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:16,177
Feed him well,

353
00:24:16,177 --> 00:24:19,177
Regale him.

354
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,782
Take this.

355
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:34,633
From now on, this responsibility, too,

356
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:38,422
Lies in your hands.

357
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:43,432
Just think that

358
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:47,882
Reverend Subhanallah is dead!

359
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:54,416
The wretch has been ensepulchred beneath the sweet redolence of banknotes!

360
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:57,534
Stop, Reverend.

361
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,030
By my love and purity...

362
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,629
Put on this turban,

363
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:16,970
And throw this wastrel out of the house.

364
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:31,967
I, too, proclaim today -

365
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:36,271
'The righteous and the sinful cannot live under one roof'.

366
00:25:43,492 --> 00:25:46,148
Get out of here, you blighter!

367
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,048
I will take that I'd given birthed you,

368
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:54,121
Raised you, and handed you to the times.

369
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:56,176
Get out! Out!

370
00:25:56,176 --> 00:26:00,175
Before my motherly affection surrenders before your sins!

371
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,470
Pick up your things from here,

372
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,208
And begone forever!

373
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,878
Out of my sights!

374
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:08,468
Go!
-Stop --

375
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,678
Stop it, Ruqaiyya.

376
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:11,806
Stop it.

377
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:16,938
It is not my desire to separate a mother from her son.

378
00:26:17,449 --> 00:26:21,324
Tell him to stay here,

379
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:25,478
And keep causing me misery.

380
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:28,459
Now, if I

381
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:31,409
Separate a mother from her son,

382
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,009
Will God be pleased with me?

383
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:39,763
I'm faced with a difficulty on either side.

384
00:26:39,763 --> 00:26:43,747
Don't turn away and leave, Reverend.

385
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:46,561
Exercise your authority as a father.

386
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,293
Whack him.

387
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,811
Slap him so hard

388
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:53,811
That the pain of it stings at him forever.

389
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:01,322
You're accosting my helplessness.

390
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:06,261
You should at least know so much

391
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:10,120
That seeing the son's temerity

392
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Has brought tears to the father's eyes.

393
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,733
The courage to slap is not left in him.

394
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:25,502
Let him rot in here.

395
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:29,012
Do not proclaim greatness before fate.

396
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:34,086
For this crime of living under the same roof as him,

397
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,110
I shall offer

398
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,958
Two prayers of forgiveness.

399
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,384
Then, let us see what God wills.

400
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:45,426
Perhaps

401
00:27:45,426 --> 00:27:49,957
Out of this pain,

402
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:53,246
<i>He</i> may mend his ways!

403
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:15,935
Don't worry, my dear, your name won't come up.

404
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:19,779
Forget that you told me anything.

405
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,420
Oh God!

406
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:24,367
What happened, sister?

407
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,432
I told his sister...

408
00:28:27,432 --> 00:28:29,241
Mentioned your name too...

409
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,509
Hang up, quick!

410
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,563
I'm good as dead!

411
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:34,597
You won't die.

412
00:28:34,597 --> 00:28:38,829
I'll ask his sister not to name you in front of him. Bye.

413
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:53,963
Hello?

414
00:28:53,963 --> 00:28:55,812
Has he been caught?

415
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,405
Yes.

416
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:03,247
Talk about Eladio...

417
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:04,652
Oh yes --

418
00:29:04,652 --> 00:29:06,229
Please,

419
00:29:06,229 --> 00:29:08,571
Don't tell him Eladio ratted him out.

420
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:10,472
The poor chap's getting worried.

421
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:12,173
I won't.

422
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:13,996
What happened to your voice?

423
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:16,320
You haven't even thanked me.

424
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,973
Thank you.

425
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:21,569
But I request you, Lubna,

426
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:25,259
If you get wind of something like this again,

427
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,259
Please don't tell me.

428
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,210
Go now; she said she won't tell him.

429
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,111
Thank you.

430
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,339
Tell what?

431
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,963
And who?

432
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:42,756
You'll be delighted to hear.

433
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:44,265
The loafer Afzal --

434
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,734
Arifa's brother --

435
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:46,645
Yes?

436
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,573
I've had him nicked.

437
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:49,981
Nicked?

438
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:52,347
He was gambling on a match outside the colony.

439
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:54,136
I called Arifa and told her,

440
00:29:54,136 --> 00:29:57,011
And I've come to know the Reverend's caught him in a raid.

441
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,760
Are you in your senses?

442
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,280
What have you got to do with him?

443
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,686
Something, certainly.

444
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:03,275
He works at our mill,

445
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:05,469
He's got the accounts officer head over heels for him,

446
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,155
That gives us <i>a lot</i> to do with him.

447
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:08,952
Now, just watch -

448
00:30:08,952 --> 00:30:10,952
The Reverend will skin him alive.

449
00:30:10,952 --> 00:30:12,909
Beware!

450
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:14,302
What?

451
00:30:14,302 --> 00:30:16,268
Don't even mention his name!

452
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:17,822
He may be Arifa's brother,

453
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:19,581
The Reverend's son,

454
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:24,051
But I despise the very sound of his name from your mouth.

455
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:25,751
He's an A1 loafer --

456
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,941
And gambler.

457
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:27,851
Right...

458
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,271
But why do you?

459
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:30,924
I say, to the dickens with him,

460
00:30:30,924 --> 00:30:32,979
It's not like I'm having an affair with him.

461
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:36,375
Arifa had pleaded before me, so I thought I'd ask Eladio.

462
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,368
What do I know him?

463
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:41,149
I turn away if I come across him.

464
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:43,713
Stop talking about him!

465
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,260
Why are you crying now?

466
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:09,168
I'm wicked, am I not?

467
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,366
Yes.

468
00:31:10,366 --> 00:31:12,362
You're wicked.

469
00:31:12,564 --> 00:31:15,496
You made Dad cry.

470
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:18,077
Now, even a lifetime of weeping

471
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:21,919
Cannot possibly recompense those tears.

472
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:25,076
Listen.

473
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:29,230
Remember this...

474
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,495
I'll weep all my life,

475
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:38,186
But find peace only when I have recompensed those tears.

476
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:40,422
I'm serving dinner; come and have some.

477
00:31:40,422 --> 00:31:45,085
I'll die of hunger but not have a bite.

478
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:53,822
I went to office,

479
00:31:53,822 --> 00:31:57,070
Having decided

480
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,639
That I won't gamble again.

481
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:02,971
But that blighter Babloo --

482
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:07,899
Kept on calling, and I kept telling him that I won't play.

483
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:13,459
But --

484
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:18,123
I fell for the lure of 30,000.

485
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:25,638
He's not a blighter,

486
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:28,696
<i>I</i>'m the blighter!

487
00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:38,612
If I had the slightest hint

488
00:32:38,612 --> 00:32:42,913
That Dad would cry like this if he found out,

489
00:32:42,913 --> 00:32:46,077
I'd never have played.

490
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,311
I swear by you.

491
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,634
If you think

492
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:57,651
I'm lying under my oath by you,

493
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:00,129
Then I'm not wicked,

494
00:33:00,129 --> 00:33:03,105
I'm the most vile and dastardly.

495
00:33:03,518 --> 00:33:04,827
Alright...

496
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:07,131
Have something to eat...

497
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:13,241
I'll talk to Dad if you have some food.

498
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:18,543
I've never given an assurance.

499
00:33:18,543 --> 00:33:23,603
I've got a feeling he'll forgive you.

500
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:38,294
I'll have something.

501
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:08,313
Give us our lives, O Gracious Lord, in Your Surrender, and admit into the Safety of Your Peace.

502
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:26,251
You come with an endorsement?

503
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:29,617
I've come to assure you.

504
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:34,914
He swore by my head for the first time.

505
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:38,697
I swear today that he won't gamble again.

506
00:35:38,697 --> 00:35:42,322
He won't smoke cigarettes or weed.

507
00:35:42,322 --> 00:35:45,884
He'll be honest and principled in his work.

508
00:35:45,884 --> 00:35:48,878
He was weeping because you had shed tears.

509
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:54,067
I said that even a lifetime of weeping cannot possibly recompense Dad's tears.

510
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:56,042
And he said,

511
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:59,072
'I'll weep all my life'

512
00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:03,624
'But find peace only when I have atoned for them'.

513
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:06,064
Will he pray?

514
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:08,286
We'll know at daybreak.

515
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:12,036
Just forgive him. Don't strike a deal.

516
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,669
I forgive him.

517
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:27,198
Come on. Have dinner with him.

518
00:36:27,198 --> 00:36:30,164
With the unfaithful liar!

519
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:34,653
With the redeemed.

520
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:47,746
I agree to what you say.

521
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:50,619
But remember

522
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,665
He'll finish you off as well

523
00:36:52,665 --> 00:36:56,849
Where there won't be the slightest relief. Yes.

524
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,048
Hey, Afzal!

525
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:20,831
You bugger!

526
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:23,102
I heard you won 30,000 yesterday?

527
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:24,978
Secretly earnin' your riches, eh?

528
00:37:24,978 --> 00:37:27,030
Hey, Afzal!

529
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,390
It's him.

530
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,657
Whatever his character may be like,

531
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:09,838
You got to admit he's got those looks!

532
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:23,949
Hey!

533
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:26,313
What happened to your head?

534
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:28,192
Got injured.

535
00:38:28,192 --> 00:38:33,026
Your heart was injured... But you've bandaged your head!

536
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,442
It's a real one, innit?

537
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,300
I've had an accident, sir.

538
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,815
Why am I not surprised?

539
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:44,412
Let's see where it's hurt <i>him</i>.

540
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:46,036
Excuse me, sir?

541
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:49,784
There's no costing or budgeting in love.

542
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:52,988
You never know how much you may end up spending.

543
00:38:52,988 --> 00:38:55,446
It must've cost 10,000.

544
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:56,496
What?

545
00:38:56,496 --> 00:38:58,584
Getting the car repaired, of course.

546
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:01,285
No. Just 2,500.

547
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:04,358
So to speak, the first meeting cost you 2,500.
-Good morning! Good morning, sir!

548
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:06,314
Good morning... Morning, Sir!

549
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:09,427
'Morning. Very good morning.

550
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:12,547
Why don't I see your wound?

551
00:39:12,547 --> 00:39:16,500
Perhaps you've been hurt on the inside?

552
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,850
Miss Rosy?

553
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,461
What happened to you?

554
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:28,126
You got injured?

555
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:29,657
Yes.

556
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:33,961
But how?

557
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:37,187
You were fine in the evening.

558
00:39:37,187 --> 00:39:39,060
I had the accident in the evening!

559
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,272
A car hit me from behind when I was taking a U-turn!

560
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,630
You may leave.

561
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,310
Would you happen to have a pen?

562
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,000
I'd like some tea.

563
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
