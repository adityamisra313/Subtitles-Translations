Here's your tea.

8
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:41,016
Hey!

9
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,684
Yes?

10
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:46,044
Did he pray at daybreak?

11
00:01:46,044 --> 00:01:50,111
I went to wake him up. Smiled in his sleep as he glimpsed me.

12
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:53,955
I thought he was dreaming, so I thought I'd let him.

13
00:01:53,955 --> 00:01:56,907
I'll wake him up at daybreak tomorrow.

14
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,191
I'll get you into University this time.

15
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,939
Ask him when gets back to check when the admissions open.

16
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:11,627
But what about

17
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,565
Co-education?

18
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:16,751
What's the big deal?

19
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:19,490
Maintaining one's decency is in one's own hands.

20
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,806
You come across men even in the markets.

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,299
That's co-education too,

22
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,616
So, to speak.

23
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,139
Dad!

24
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,950
I know when the admissions open.

25
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,974
When?

26
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:36,458
The 25th of the next month.

27
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,096
Right.

28
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,095
Would you serve some food? I'm starving.

29
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:18,744
Where's Mum?

30
00:03:18,744 --> 00:03:21,748
Sleeping in her room. Shall I rouse her?

31
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:22,802
No.

32
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,373
Let her sleep.

33
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,333
Who's calling you repeatedly?

34
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,686
No idea.

35
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:31,964
It's an unknown number.

36
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:36,168
Calls again if I disconnect. He's called me some 10 times since the morning.

37
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,863
Talk to him.

38
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:50,908
I will for real.

39
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:52,398
So what?

40
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,129
Do you feel like insulting someone?

41
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:57,643
Hello?

42
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:58,926
Where's Farah?

43
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,279
Why isn't she answering the phone?

44
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,738
Who's on the line?

45
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:04,800
You forgot me? Didn't even recognise my voice...

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,112
Will you keep on with this blather or tell who you are?

47
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:10,724
It's Mehtab, Lubna...

48
00:04:11,066 --> 00:04:13,695
Oh, Mehtab...

49
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,436
Where's Farah?

50
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:19,343
I've been trying her number. She's not answering.

51
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,760
She keeps her phone on silent mode at the University.

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,494
Want to talk to her?
-Yes, please.

53
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:28,738
I thought she would've called me by the time I reached Karachi.

54
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:32,148
Here, Farah. It's Mehtab.

55
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,023
Hello?

56
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,245
It's Mehtab, Farah.

57
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:41,903
I know.

58
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:43,591
Didn't you think of me?

59
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,212
I did.

60
00:04:45,212 --> 00:04:48,457
But I couldn't figure how I'd talk to Dad.

61
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:49,490
Talk?

62
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,830
To Dad?

63
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,845
What?

64
00:04:51,845 --> 00:04:55,248
You'll know within minutes when I've talked to him.

65
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:58,320
Dad'll be calling you first.

66
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,334
So,

67
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:01,446
How go the preparations for the wedding?

68
00:05:01,446 --> 00:05:03,319
Whose wedding?

69
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:04,793
Very funny.

70
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:06,812
I like this one.

71
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,277
Ain't no joke.

72
00:05:08,277 --> 00:05:09,945
I'm seriously asking you -

73
00:05:09,945 --> 00:05:12,649
Whose wedding are you talking about?

74
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:15,520
Ours, dear, of course!

75
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,359
I find it awkward to answer such a question.

76
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,763
Ohh...

77
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:22,886
The one planned for the 15th of December...

78
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:24,988
You're talking about that, right?

79
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:26,990
Again, very funny.

80
00:05:27,195 --> 00:05:30,401
You're angry because I didn't call you when I got here?

81
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,705
Just ask why.

82
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,103
I was waiting that you would --
-Look, Mehtab.

83
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:37,795
It would hurt you to know,

84
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,804
But let me be very honest with you -

85
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:41,650
This proposal is unacceptable!

86
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,138
You're talking about the 15th of December?

87
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:45,757
Well, that December will never come!

88
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:49,304
Or it won't have a 15th!

89
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:51,220
Such fury!

90
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:52,946
Forgive me.

91
00:05:52,946 --> 00:05:54,318
I was wrong.

92
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:55,648
What?

93
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:57,132
<i>I</i> was so blimming wrong!

94
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,586
I should've told you before you'd left.

95
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:02,460
But it's alright. I'll tell you now.

96
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,185
Our second meeting on the terrace

97
00:06:05,185 --> 00:06:07,653
Was our last meeting.

98
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:09,748
L -- Last meeting?

99
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,874
La finale!

100
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,947
Is it something Mehtab said?

101
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:30,645
No.

102
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:33,822
Something <i>I</i> said...
-Go on.

103
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:36,785
I told him I'm not marrying him.

104
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,464
That this proposal is unacceptable...

105
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,551
No matter the cost...

106
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:42,325
Then suffer the consequences.

107
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:43,485
What consequences?

108
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:44,468
An earful from Dad,

109
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:47,741
And you won't be able to stand Mum's ululation!

110
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,580
I don't worry so much about Mum...

111
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,383
But Dad --
-Dad may even slap you!

112
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:55,540
Oh God!

113
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,976
What have I done?

114
00:06:57,976 --> 00:07:00,645
What if he draws his gun?

115
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,153
Gun?

116
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:03,395
Don't you remember?

117
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:05,636
He'd drawn his gun when Aunt...

118
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,103
And fired too.

119
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:10,337
It's another thing no one got hit...

120
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:14,687
But that can't happen every time...

121
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,280
Where are you going?

122
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,050
To my room.

123
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,723
Hide in <i>my</i> room.

124
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,480
But why?

125
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,580
Going before them is dangerous.

126
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,991
You may get hit

127
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,250
Where you won't need a second bullet.

128
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,998
Afzal!

129
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,885
Afzal!

130
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:57,368
Come here. Get in.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Whose car is this?

132
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,176
My brother's.

133
00:08:06,176 --> 00:08:07,316
Get in, quick.

134
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:09,580
Don't ask too many questions.

135
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,855
No.

136
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,328
I'm fine.

137
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,204
I'll walk. Thank you.

138
00:08:14,204 --> 00:08:16,090
Why are you saying 'Thank you'?

139
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,418
C'mon, get in!

140
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,261
I've decided to ride a car home

141
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,490
Only when I own one.

142
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:28,099
How will you own one?

143
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,077
Clerks don't get to own cars.

144
00:08:43,660 --> 00:09:03,010
[Call to prayer]

145
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,259
Farah...

146
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,393
Don't you think you're taking it for granted?

147
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:55,549
As, say, with a wedding.

148
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:57,689
When you're invited to one,

149
00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,169
You accept it with delight.

150
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:01,330
And then think,

151
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,175
'I'll attend if I can spare time',

152
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:07,928
'Otherwise, I'll call and say, "Sorry, mate, I'm busy".'

153
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:09,333
And, as it happens,

154
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,520
You're done for.

155
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,821
Don't remind me my mistakes!

156
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,946
I'm no Mehtab Chawla

157
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:26,162
To think we have an 'understanding' if you scold me.

158
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,988
Please, Lubna,

159
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:30,606
I've realised my mistakes.

160
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:33,879
I should've rejected the proposal before they left.

161
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,896
And if I could not,

162
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:39,051
Then I shouldn't have phoned Mehtab and said,

163
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,989
'This proposal is unacceptable'!

164
00:10:40,989 --> 00:10:42,982
You're regretting what you did?

165
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:44,078
Obviously.

166
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,031
I should've talked to Mum instead of Mehtab Chawla.

167
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:49,640
No, Madame, you should've talked to Dad.

168
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,971
What?

169
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:52,874
Talking to Mum will get you nowhere.

170
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,141
She'll just say,

171
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:57,240
'Monseigneur, this girl will drag you through the mire'!

172
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,601
And Dad will actually drag me through a mire!

173
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,244
No way. Dad's not like that.

174
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,200
He'll be a bit furious to hear it.

175
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,767
But then ask sternly,

176
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,949
'Is that your final decision'?

177
00:11:09,164 --> 00:11:10,541
Sure?

178
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:11,869
Be positive!

179
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,889
Just think as if that's going to happen.

180
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,343
Show some sensibility,

181
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,687
And when he asks

182
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,157
If it's your final decision,

183
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:19,503
Say firmly:

184
00:11:19,503 --> 00:11:22,196
'Yes, Dad. It's my final decision'.

185
00:11:22,196 --> 00:11:23,827
So he won't slap me?

186
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:27,150
Good fathers don't slap their young daughters.

187
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,684
Surely he'll ask the reason?

188
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,245
Reason?
-He'll surely ask what Mehtab's fault had been.

189
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:35,864
And, in that case,

190
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:39,565
Why I'd not mentioned it before the date was fixed or before he left.

191
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,559
That's right...

192
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,320
He'll surely ask you that...

193
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,983
What'll you say?

194
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:48,731
You tell me.

195
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm totally blank. I don't know.

196
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:06,904
Oh yes!

197
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:10,214
Say the same you did to Mehtab!

198
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:12,253
What did I say to Mehtab?

199
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:14,894
'I love someone else',

200
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:18,082
'We used to write letters back in the day, and now we talk for hours on the phone'.

201
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,673
Say that to <i>Dad</i>?

202
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,690
No. Say that to Mum.

203
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,156
What about the mire, then?

204
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,680
Don't worry.

205
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,890
You'd be neck-deep in the mire by then.

206
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,488
I mean

207
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:32,480
You would've said to Dad that you don't want to marry Mehtab.

208
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,763
He'll ask why.

209
00:12:33,763 --> 00:12:36,546
Tell him you'd only tell Mum.

210
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:39,354
Yes. That's possible.

211
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:42,460
But when do I say this?

212
00:12:43,651 --> 00:12:45,281
Before he watches the news.

213
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:48,210
I wonder why...
-Easy.

214
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,550
There's all sorts of bad news on the TV,

215
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,640
Your news will be the icing on the cake.

216
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,636
Good Lord, he'll think you're Kamikaze attacking him.

217
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,873
Mademoiselle Farah,

218
00:12:58,873 --> 00:12:59,870
Yes?

219
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,417
Monseigneur wants you downstairs.

220
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,011
Yes, Dad?

221
00:13:56,376 --> 00:13:57,902
Sit.

222
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,274
Yes, Dad?

223
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,737
You talked to Mehtab today?

224
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,720
Yes, Dad.

225
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,313
He called.

226
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:23,503
What did you say when he mentioned the marriage?

227
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,376
Tell me. What did you say?

228
00:14:31,376 --> 00:14:32,924
I -- said

229
00:14:32,924 --> 00:14:36,459
That this proposal is unacceptable.

230
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,665
Was it something he said?

231
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:49,748
Not at all -- he just wanted to talk.

232
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:52,881
If you'd rather that he not call you before the marriage,

233
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:55,000
I can ask him not to.

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,989
It's not about that, Dad...

235
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,842
What is it, then?

236
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:02,871
The thing is --

237
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:05,482
The fault -- was mine.

238
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:06,731
I should've --

239
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:09,045
Told you earlier.

240
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:11,375
What is it that you

241
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,124
Should've told me earlier?

242
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,380
That I --

243
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:33,346
I don't want to marry Mehtab.
-Couldn't you say it before the date was decided?

244
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:37,057
Are you bent on dragging us through the mire?

245
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,326
Don't worry about that.

246
00:15:39,326 --> 00:15:42,575
Just tell me the reason.

247
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,068
I'll tell Mum the reason...

248
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,534
Come with me, then.

249
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,830
What did she say?

250
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,888
She will not marry Mehtab.

251
00:17:26,251 --> 00:17:28,730
Call Mehtab and convey this rejection.

252
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,765
Say that it's not possible now.

253
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:33,656
Why not?

254
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:37,514
She loves someone else.

255
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,369
Who?

256
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,859
Should I ask her that too?

257
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,240
Obviously.

258
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,195
It isn't something I can ask.

259
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,746
Get all the details from her.

260
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,044
Who he is, what he does,

261
00:18:03,044 --> 00:18:04,563
Where he lives,

262
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,661
His family background. Everything.

263
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:09,309
What do you mean?

264
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,117
Try to understand, Irsa Begum.

265
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:15,480
This isn't 1992

266
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,680
That I could impose my will at gunpoint.

267
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,980
If she does not want to marry Mehtab,

268
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,646
That's okay.

269
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,213
I will decline the proposal.

270
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,599
But first, find out more about him.

271
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,302
What's his status, family background, and character like?

272
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:39,470
A tad here or there in rank and status is fine by me.

273
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,403
But I will not compromise

274
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:45,536
On family background and character.

275
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,765
Go to sleep.

276
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,316
How do I fall asleep?

277
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:08,706
Then brace yourself,

278
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:10,759
For you'll be asked in a while

279
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,176
Who you love

280
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:13,325
Who he is,

281
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:14,531
What's his status and rank,

282
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:15,591
What does he do,

283
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:17,935
What's his character like?

284
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,898
Bolt the door.

285
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:26,229
Bolt the door, please.

286
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,170
And if anyone asks,

287
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,501
Say, 'She dropped dead the moment she came in'!

288
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,633
It's time for dinner.

289
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,257
Bon appétit!

290
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:59,020
I mean -- Serve everyone.

291
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,052
Farah's not hungry.

292
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:03,096
You're not hungry either?

293
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,579
Why are you asking questions?

294
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,883
Go and say that Lubna's not having dinner either.

295
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,094
Why don't you go?

296
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,953
Go and see how everything is going on!

297
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,106
Don't be crazy,

298
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:26,595
Sleep on quietly.

299
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,704
If anyone asks, I'll say you took sleeping pills.

300
00:20:28,704 --> 00:20:30,705
What'll that do?

301
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:32,518
Buy some time!

302
00:20:32,518 --> 00:20:35,955
Think about his name, address, family, and character.

303
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:37,596
If there's no one,

304
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:38,874
Imagine there is.

305
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:39,943
Name him,

306
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:41,349
Think about his family

307
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,817
And take it for a given

308
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:46,310
That all of Hyderabad is in awe of his character.

309
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,330
If I keep on lying like this,

310
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,478
What'll happen to my character?

311
00:20:50,478 --> 00:20:52,967
Then, there's just one way out.

312
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,487
Which is?

313
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,362
Tell the truth and marry Mehtab.

314
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:57,635
No way!

315
00:20:57,635 --> 00:21:00,370
Then let untruth be your master and say anything you like.

316
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,595
Worrying about your character will ruin your life.

317
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,591
Shall we go up to the terrace?
-What's up there?

318
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:11,600
You just have to lie.

319
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,142
Sit here and prepare yourself.

320
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:16,850
If you gad about everywhere, you'd be caught with your pants down!

321
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,001
I'll take whatever comes my way.

322
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,551
Do you know how happy Dad was today?

323
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,581
I know.

324
00:22:17,581 --> 00:22:19,824
You don't.

325
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,958
He said, 'Apply to a University'.

326
00:22:24,238 --> 00:22:25,711
What?

327
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,115
No way --

328
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,741
I swear by you.

329
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:31,481
It's a golden opportunity, Afzal.

330
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,880
Yes.

331
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,723
Why, sure. Do it.

332
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:36,225
I'll pay your fees.

333
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:38,915
I'm not talking about admissions and fees.

334
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:40,453
Then?

335
00:22:40,453 --> 00:22:43,441
Tell me about her.

336
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,080
Who?

337
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,664
The girl who writes letters to you.

338
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,637
Just tell me her name and address. I'll talk to Dad.

339
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,480
What'd you talk about?

340
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,532
Won't you marry her?

341
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:08,326
I'll ask Dad to talk to her family.

342
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,403
First, ask -

343
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:21,336
Will she marry me?

344
00:23:21,336 --> 00:23:24,711
As if she writes letters to you just for fun!

345
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,650
Let's just say she does.

346
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,709
My marriage to her isn't possible.

347
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,193
So,

348
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:37,498
Promise me

349
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:40,014
You'll never mention her again,

350
00:23:40,014 --> 00:23:43,375
Nor will you ask her name.

351
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:45,321
Just think as if

352
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:47,772
There's no one...

353
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:50,584
No name...

354
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,750
Just... A dream...

355
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,974
That delights me when I imagine it...

356
00:23:57,974 --> 00:24:00,701
And if this isn't acceptable either,

357
00:24:00,701 --> 00:24:02,982
Go and ask for Dad's opinion on it.

358
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:05,015
Ask him.

359
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:10,976
If delighting myself with a dream is sinful,

360
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:13,692
I will not.

361
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,495
Are you friends with anyone from your University?

362
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:30,368
Shut up!

363
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,237
Do I ever make friends with anyone?

364
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,721
A class fellow

365
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,581
Who could be let in on it and asked for help?

366
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:38,878
Don't even think about it!

367
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,248
Farhad!

368
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:47,181
Aunt Mahjabeen's son?
-Yes!

369
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,982
He'll agree in an instant!

370
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,800
What else do we want?

371
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,170
Are you touched in the head?

372
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,982
If I name someone from the family,

373
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:56,404
I'd have to get married to him.

374
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:58,141
God forgive me,

375
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:00,700
But he's worse than Mehtab!

376
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,244
Don't put up a blank face, missy, find a way out!

377
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:04,935
Who's talking about his face?

378
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:06,370
Aunt would've set up camp here

379
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,014
Before I've even mentioned his name!

380
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,496
He should be the type

381
00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:14,516
Who stands firm for four months,

382
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,290
And vanishes in a flash as the moment of the marriage approaches.

383
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,191
Oh God, very theatrical!

384
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:22,560
So what if it is theatrical?

385
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,961
I'm not marrying Mehtab.

386
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:25,916
No.

387
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,920
My heart doesn't agree to it.

388
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,559
In fact, it isn't just about the heart.

389
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:32,322
My mind asks me to be wary!

390
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,729
Alright, how about Aunt Mehru's Jamil Akhtar?

391
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:37,421
You've officially gone barmy!

392
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:39,446
Don't even think about anyone from the family.

393
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:40,780
Who, then?

394
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,003
You're not on speaking terms with anyone outside,

395
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:45,160
You haven't got eyes for anyone in the family,

396
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,903
Then you've got no option except Barack Obama.

397
00:25:47,903 --> 00:25:49,351
What can that poor fellow do?

398
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:53,996
Launch a drone attack on Mehtab's house and resolve the entire matter in a flash.

399
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,833
Where are you off to now?

400
00:25:57,424 --> 00:25:58,628
Where would I go?

401
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:01,235
I'm just checking why Aunt hasn't come yet.

402
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:02,471
Why would she come?

403
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:03,333
Splendid.

404
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,973
She's going to come and tell you that Dad's calling you.

405
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,150
Look who we have here!

406
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,052
The Reverend's son.

407
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:39,630
The bugger's turned into a Reverend himself!

408
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,391
You bugger!

409
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:44,459
What am I hearing?

410
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:46,377
I'm getting late for work,

411
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:48,004
We'll talk when we meet later.

412
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:50,245
When are we meeting?

413
00:26:50,445 --> 00:26:52,635
You're turning your friends down

414
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:55,180
For some twopenny-halfpenny job?

415
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,526
It's not like that,

416
00:26:56,526 --> 00:26:58,340
I promise we'll meet tonight.

417
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,680
He's lying!

418
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,852
He's not coming!

419
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:04,506
His Dad's had him swear that he'll never meet Timmy and Sajid!

420
00:27:04,506 --> 00:27:05,333
Innit?

421
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,659
That's the matter, right?

422
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,255
No. That's not what it's like.

423
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:11,844
You've got to change yourself to do a job.

424
00:27:11,844 --> 00:27:14,460
I've heard you've stopped playing matches.

425
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,626
I'll play.

426
00:27:17,032 --> 00:27:18,344
But I won't gamble on it.

427
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:21,189
Why don't you just say you've been ensnared in your Dad's sermons!

428
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:23,323
I've been ensnared in Dad's sermons!

429
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:27,250
Seeing what I do brought tears to his eyes!

430
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,907
I can't bear to see his tears.

431
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,810
I'm wicked,

432
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:35,839
But not flagitious.

433
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,680
The sun's come up!

434
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,710
It's 9 already!

435
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,906
Oh my God...

436
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,850
Thank God!

437
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:28,280
You'll be thrown out of the University!

438
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,316
Get ready quick, Farah! Double time!

439
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:33,583
I'm thankful it ended there!

440
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,450
Mum must've explained everything.

441
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,284
And Dad must've decided, too

442
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,658
'Even if she loves someone',

443
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:42,643
'We'll talk some other day'.

444
00:28:42,643 --> 00:28:44,930
I'll offer two additional prayers when I'm back

445
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,763
In fact, I'll offer all my prayers!

446
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,732
What are you looking at?

447
00:28:49,732 --> 00:28:52,640
Go to your room and get ready, quick!

448
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,746
I'm going!

449
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,860
I know I'm late!

450
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,595
Good morning!

451
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,247
Good morning!

452
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:07,856
I've called to apologise.

453
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,673
Mum called and told me

454
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:13,784
I was left screaming in horror; after all, it's between us; we'll resolve it together.

455
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:15,889
Where's your Mum?

456
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,311
No --

457
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:19,950
I swear, it's not Mum's fault either.

458
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,550
It's just she talked to a friend, and --

459
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,571
She suggested it.

460
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:27,274
Where's your Mum's friend?

461
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:28,352
Hey!

462
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,300
You don't even know her.

463
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,150
Besides,

464
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,765
What will you say to her?

465
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,365
I'll thank her.

466
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:37,125
Say a big 'Thank you' to her.

467
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,050
And

468
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,147
Thank you very much too!

469
00:29:40,147 --> 00:29:44,233
I was growing anxious how I could talk about it to Mum and Dad.

470
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,134
So sweet of you!

471
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:47,881
Alright, now...

472
00:29:47,881 --> 00:29:50,846
I'm getting late for my classes!

473
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,120
Peace be upon you.

474
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,692
Please sign this photocopy

475
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:23,144
And confirm the receipt of this letter.

476
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:23,970
Letter?

477
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,943
It's a memo.

478
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:26,989
What's a memo?

479
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:29,717
You'll find out when you read it.

480
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,329
Read it after you've signed this.

481
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,070
Please don't talk to <i>me</i> about anything!

482
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,174
Talk to <i>me</i>!

483
00:30:52,174 --> 00:30:54,767
<i>I</i>'ve signed the memo.

484
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,166
What's this you've written?

485
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,086
That I t -- tease Miss Rosy, I --

486
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:12,895
Pester her, harrass her?

487
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:14,878
Can you see this?

488
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:19,005
Miss Rosy has complained against you.

489
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,008
Look at me, young man!

490
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:27,161
I've been easy on you when writing that.

491
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,840
Miss Rosy had even said

492
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,600
That she fears for her honour around you!

493
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,687
Around <i>me</i>?

494
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,401
Over here!

495
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:43,650
I've even come to know the thing about the injury.

496
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,449
Be thankful

497
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:48,700
I did not write that Fescennine story in the memo!

498
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,262
Fescennine story?

499
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:51,666
The thing about the injury --

500
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,500
What about the injury?

501
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,562
Have some shame.

502
00:31:55,562 --> 00:31:58,196
You thumb a lift from a girl,

503
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:01,706
And try to assault her?

504
00:32:01,706 --> 00:32:03,642
I'm ashamed to think of it!

505
00:32:03,642 --> 00:32:05,620
You're the son of a priest.

506
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,864
Look at your father's dignity and honour, and fear for yourself!

507
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:13,785
Yes?

508
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,148
Yes sir.

509
00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:17,011
Coming, sir.

510
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:19,886
Come.

511
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:21,130
Where?

512
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,960
Monseigneur has called you.

513
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,142
And beware!

514
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,731
Don't you dare lie to <i>him</i>!

515
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:28,301
Come.

516
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,310
Listen, Farah.

517
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,081
Come here.

518
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,121
Yes, Mum?

519
00:32:57,121 --> 00:33:00,233
Tell him to come and meet your father.

520
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:01,521
Who?

521
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,211
What's his name?

522
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:04,498
Name?

523
00:33:04,498 --> 00:33:05,654
Don't be afraid.

524
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:11,452
Your father said that if he's from a good family and of good character, he has no problem.

525
00:33:11,452 --> 00:33:16,143
A tad here or there in rank and status is fine by him.

526
00:33:17,202 --> 00:33:19,200
I told you, you've nothing to fear.

527
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,971
Call him here.

528
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,350
You don't believe me, do you?

529
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,157
Alright,

530
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:30,561
Go to University for now; call me when you believe me and tell me when he'll be coming.

531
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,906
It'd be better if he came in the evening.

532
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,956
Get a move on!

533
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,753
What is this?

534
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:00,892
It's all a lie, sir.

535
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,419
I want her here, Mr Chengezi.

536
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,277
Please wait, sir...

537
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:08,530
Why are you calling her here?

538
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,445
So that she can say all of this to my face?

539
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:13,654
I accept that she would've said it.

540
00:34:13,654 --> 00:34:18,226
And I accept that Mr Chengezi reported it to you because she'd said it.

541
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:20,970
But I want to ask one thing, sir.

542
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,140
If her words are taken for the truth, why is what I say necessarily false?

543
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,845
I saw you get in the car with her with my own eyes.

544
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:30,919
And that bandage on her head - she's shown me the wound.

545
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:33,339
A wound half an inch wide!

546
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:36,201
Does that prove I'm lying, sir?

547
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,161
Do you know where you're standing?

548
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,974
And who you're blabbing before?

549
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:44,692
I've come to realise today where I stand, sir.

550
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:48,740
I can do nothing but say that I'm not the culprit.

551
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,726
You may pronounce whatever decision you see fit.

552
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:54,690
I have great respect for your father.

553
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,577
He leads my prayers.

554
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:01,506
I'd given you this job on his request.

555
00:35:01,506 --> 00:35:05,742
Do you know what he'd said when he recommended you?

556
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:08,427
He would've said, 'My son is not virtuous, sir'.

557
00:35:08,427 --> 00:35:12,946
'He gambles on matches, smokes weed with his vagabond friends'.

558
00:35:12,946 --> 00:35:19,100
But he wouldn't have said, 'My son does not respect the dignity and honour of women'.

559
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,514
That's one vice I don't have, sir.

560
00:35:22,514 --> 00:35:29,875
Perhaps, trusting my inculpability from this transgression, my father used to forgive every trespass of mine.

561
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:33,779
I hereby resign from this job, sir.

562
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,343
For the first time, I am not the offender.

563
00:35:38,343 --> 00:35:41,906
But I've got a feeling I am.

564
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,785
Please do mention this crime of mine when you meet Dad.

565
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:51,473
I, too, want to see, sir,

566
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:55,690
How much Dad distrusts me.

567
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,666
With peace, sir.

568
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,530
He's just being dramatic, sir.

569
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,400
Did you

570
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,274
Wake him up at daybreak?

571
00:36:44,274 --> 00:36:45,520
I didn't need to!

572
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,491
He was praying when I entered his room.

573
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:49,054
He's awakened now, Dad.

574
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:52,775
There's no need to knock and wake him up now.

575
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,269
Do you

576
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:57,980
Remember Hazrat Sahib?

577
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,418
Of course.

578
00:36:59,418 --> 00:37:01,690
When he was young,

579
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,694
He used to seat him in his lap.

580
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:07,315
He loved him so much.

581
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,973
He would turn his gaze to me and say,

582
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:12,769
'Remember, Subhanallah',

583
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:15,610
'He'll grow to become a great man one day'.

584
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,598
Take him to his grave someday

585
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,834
And say to him, 'Bless you'.

586
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:22,857
'What you said has come true'.

587
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:25,380
With blessings, your son has become a clerk.

588
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,483
Oh, please, Ruqaiyya Begum...

589
00:37:28,483 --> 00:37:31,118
That's how everything starts.

590
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:34,089
A tree does not grow tall in one day.

591
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:36,010
Take me, for example.

592
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,858
When I got married to you,

593
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:39,521
What was I?

594
00:37:39,521 --> 00:37:41,953
And what are you now?

595
00:37:43,368 --> 00:37:46,198
You just became a priest, Reverend.

596
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:49,751
You couldn't become a great man.

597
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,342
There is no other power [but God's]!

598
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,210
Hello?

599
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,178
Hello!

600
00:38:58,178 --> 00:38:59,288
How are you, sire?

601
00:38:59,288 --> 00:39:00,988
How goes your job?

602
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:01,889
Good!

603
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:02,835
Very good!

604
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,546
Ohh...

605
00:39:04,546 --> 00:39:08,190
You're speaking English to proclaim your majesty!

606
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,456
My dear, show your majesty through your work. Many can speak English 'round here.

607
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:15,219
I'm working very hard...

608
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,868
What's that noise?

609
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:20,924
Noise --?

610
00:39:20,924 --> 00:39:22,916
The TV's on.

611
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,663
Mr Chengezi has a thing for the matches.

612
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:28,230
So he's just like you!

613
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,236
Yes.

614
00:39:29,236 --> 00:39:30,623
When's the break?

615
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:31,770
Break?

616
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,741
I mean when do you have your lunch?

617
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,047
Why don't you ask straight away?

618
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:39,659
I have my lunch when I'm hungry.

619
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:41,440
Hey? It's 2 p.m!

620
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,916
You're not feeling hungry?
-Oh?

621
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,324
It's 2 already?

622
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:47,248
Alright. Quickly now, have your lunch.

623
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:49,847
I know you've got a lot of work. Keep on doing it.

624
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:52,838
But take care of your health.

625
00:39:52,838 --> 00:39:54,137
I'll eat in a while.

626
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,977
And remember to offer your midday prayers.

627
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,053
Dad feels good to hear about it.

628
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:01,318
I will.

629
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:02,237
Alright.

630
00:40:02,237 --> 00:40:03,768
Bye.

631
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
