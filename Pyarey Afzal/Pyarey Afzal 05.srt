7
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,577
Thought of a name?

8
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:39,316
No good.

9
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:41,269
Who'd meet my family?

10
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:44,286
Gotta start with someone.

11
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:45,770
Shut up.

12
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,237
Okayyy... What's it to me anyway?

13
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:48,641
But what'll you do about Mum?

14
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:51,581
She'll ask you when he's coming the moment you reach home.

15
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:53,002
I've got my answer.

16
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,192
Tell me.

17
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,021
He's out of town.

18
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:58,032
He's in Karachi.

19
00:02:58,032 --> 00:02:58,813
Right...

20
00:02:58,813 --> 00:03:00,463
That's good.

21
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:04,973
But then, Dad will ask for his number.

22
00:03:05,374 --> 00:03:08,270
Gee, I feel like crashing into a wall!

23
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,510
Hmm...

24
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,075
Can't be much better than Mehtab.

25
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,586
Just crash into Mehtab and marry him!

26
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,300
Not Karachi.

27
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,306
America.

28
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:20,492
Don't drag America into this.

29
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,462
It's aready got its hands full with its own share of quandaries!

30
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,673
Just try to understand!

31
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:26,184
I'll say he's gone to America.

32
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:27,883
He'll be back in a few days.

33
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:30,174
And if he isn't?

34
00:03:30,174 --> 00:03:32,720
I'm sure I can find someone in a few days.

35
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,564
She'll also ask why you didn't take the driver along.

36
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:38,135
Be ready with your answer.

37
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,209
It's him, isn't it?

38
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,416
Arifa's brother?

39
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,607
You're right...

40
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:57,062
But what's he doing here?

41
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:00,052
He should be at the office right now.

42
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:03,209
He's an A1 loafer.

43
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,541
Skiving off again, I'm sure.

44
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,636
You left the driver here when you left?

45
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:55,127
I nearly forgot -- Just realised --

46
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,198
I'd left the driver at home...

47
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,410
You haven't even mentioned when he's coming.

48
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,520
Sometime after the evening.

49
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,701
But not for -- a couple of days...

50
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,411
Why?

51
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:15,215
He's -- Out of the country.

52
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,200
Where is he?

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,621
I don't know --

54
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,954
He had a few options...

55
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,340
He'll tell me once he's there -- where he is!

56
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,481
I'm sure we can call him?

57
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:30,501
I'm sure, when your father is satisfied...

58
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:33,377
He hasn't slept peacefully all night.

59
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:34,867
Turning from one side to another,

60
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,303
He'd say with visible fear

61
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,676
As he glimpsed the gun,

62
00:05:37,676 --> 00:05:39,767
'Get this gun off the wall'!

63
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:41,457
Get it off then...

64
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:43,417
It's not about the gun.

65
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:45,717
Your Dad is unsettled.

66
00:05:45,717 --> 00:05:49,418
He was asking his name over breakfast.

67
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:50,920
What could I tell him?

68
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,445
You haven't even told <i>me</i>!

69
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:57,510
He was mumbling as he smoked his cigar in the morning,

70
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,319
Saying, 'I don't even know his name',

71
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,150
'And he's gonna be my son-in-law'!

72
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,699
Just a couple of days, Mum...

73
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,159
Everyone will get to know him.

74
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,987
I -- I'm not hungry at all.

75
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:12,692
Ask Aunt not to knock on our door.

76
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:14,217
Wait!

77
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:16,407
At least tell me his name!

78
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,756
I'll tell your father when he'd ask -

79
00:06:18,756 --> 00:06:21,046
'Make do with just the name for now',

80
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:24,053
'You'll get to know the rest later'.

81
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,651
Tell me. What's his name?

82
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,470
Afzal...

83
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,997
You didn't mention what happened to her...

84
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,616
It's nothing.

85
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:13,706
Nothing?

86
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:17,257
Why is she unconscious for so long then?
-It's a shock.

87
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:20,426
Perhaps she's suddenly heard some news, or...

88
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:21,652
Or?

89
00:07:21,652 --> 00:07:26,090
Are you, by any chance, getting her married to someone she doesn't like?

90
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,367
Don't tell me you could find that out too.

91
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:28,879
No, I can't,

92
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,146
But I'm a family doctor. This is why I'm asking.

93
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:34,782
Yes, it was planned...

94
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:36,467
We'd fixed the date too,

95
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,097
But then found out she's not happy with it.

96
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:41,728
What did you do?

97
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:44,695
What a good father should've done.

98
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,768
I'll call to decline today.

99
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,201
Good.

100
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,856
Tell your family not to utter his name before her.

101
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:54,825
What's his name, by the way?

102
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,375
Mehtab.

103
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,821
What a nice name!

104
00:07:57,821 --> 00:08:00,822
Anyway, she'll come to soon.

105
00:08:00,822 --> 00:08:03,317
Don't meet her before she's stable.

106
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,363
Why?

107
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:09,468
In such cases, every decent girl fears her father.

108
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,225
Okay.

109
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,406
I won't meet her.

110
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:18,932
Who's this Afzal, Lubna?

111
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,266
What's she asking?

112
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:27,726
She's asking who Afzal is.

113
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:31,597
But why's she asking? She ought to tell us!

114
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,136
The truth is,

115
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:46,246
It's gotten into her mind

116
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:48,970
That I didn't mention his full name.

117
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,277
Isn't it his full name?

118
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:52,796
No.

119
00:08:52,796 --> 00:08:55,617
His name ain't even Afzal!

120
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:57,262
I meant --

121
00:08:57,262 --> 00:08:58,750
'Afzal'

122
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,570
As in 'the best'.

123
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,550
What do you mean?

124
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,422
Not his name!

125
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:07,313
I meant his character.

126
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,529
He's the best in character.

127
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:11,733
There's no one like him, really!

128
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:13,413
Well...

129
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:15,483
I can understand that.

130
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:17,414
By the Lord, for a while, I thought

131
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:20,440
You're talking about Reverend Subhanallah's son.

132
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,597
God forgive!

133
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:36,506
God is the Greatest...

134
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,846
Farah!

135
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:08,950
Farah, wake up!

136
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,482
Get up! Mum's left!

137
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:36,890
Peace and Mercy of God be upon you...

138
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:43,405
Peace and Mercy of God be upon you...

139
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,906
God forgive all my sins...

140
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:44,371
O our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the hell fire.

141
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,586
Who's this Afzal?

142
00:12:01,586 --> 00:12:02,667
That blighter?

143
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:04,827
Reverend Subhanallah's son?

144
00:12:04,827 --> 00:12:06,517
The loafer, the vagrant!

145
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,068
You named him and said I love <i>him</i>!

146
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:12,267
That's what you think about me!

147
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:15,483
You thought you'd name anyone,

148
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,203
And I'd stay quiet!

149
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,004
Just because I'm in the soup?

150
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,990
To the dickens with it!

151
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,280
I'd much rather be in the soup

152
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,457
Than out with the help of that loafer extraordinaire!

153
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:27,507
But if you mentioned his name again,

154
00:12:27,507 --> 00:12:30,160
I'll claw your face apart!

155
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,911
Listen to me, Farah.

156
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:34,583
I changed my statement.

157
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:39,040
Mum, too, had thought I was talking about Reverend Subhanallah's son.

158
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,061
So?

159
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:42,076
Who were you talking about?

160
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,297
I was saying that he had the best character.

161
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:47,936
Unrivalled, unlike any other!

162
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,392
Oh my God...

163
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,966
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

164
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,606
I'm so wicked, am I not?

165
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:03,477
I slapped you so hard...

166
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,580
I'm sorry.

167
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,557
Please...

168
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,815
Hey!

169
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,636
What took you so long?

170
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:32,907
Greetings, Mum!

171
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,701
That's great!

172
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:44,436
You've finished your lunch.

173
00:13:44,436 --> 00:13:45,956
Hold on.

174
00:13:45,956 --> 00:13:47,320
What's the matter?

175
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,011
Why aren't you saying anything?

176
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,420
We'd asked you to become a good man.

177
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,036
Don't become so good that we start fearing you.

178
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,917
I'm going to look for my degrees and certificates.

179
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,489
No idea where I kept them.

180
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,696
Why do you need them now?

181
00:14:02,696 --> 00:14:04,976
I've gotten a job on Dad's recommendation,

182
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:08,822
But that can't prove I'm a BA.

183
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:10,953
Oh...

184
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:13,329
May I go and look for them now?

185
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:14,653
Don't.

186
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,123
All your documents are in Dad's cupboard.

187
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,883
I'll get you everything in a while.

188
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,791
Get me some tea.

189
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,871
Right away!

190
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,347
Come, Monseigneur. It's time for the 9 p.m. news bulletin.

191
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,057
I know.

192
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:24,982
Switch it off, will you?

193
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,156
What's the matter, Monseigneur?

194
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:36,937
Something bothering you?

195
00:16:38,147 --> 00:16:41,949
Nothing wrong as such,

196
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:45,160
But it weighs on my heart to remember whatever's been said...

197
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,876
She's come to now.

198
00:16:46,876 --> 00:16:49,000
Had her dinner.

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,646
If you have any suspicions or fears,

200
00:16:51,646 --> 00:16:54,736
Call and tell her openly.

201
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:57,297
I'm not talking about her.

202
00:16:57,297 --> 00:16:59,398
Who are you talking about?

203
00:16:59,398 --> 00:17:00,338
I mean --

204
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:02,308
Reverend Subhanallah's son...

205
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:03,594
What's his name?

206
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:04,615
Afzal?

207
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:05,980
Yes, Afzal.

208
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,950
No way.

209
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,416
It's not like that.

210
00:17:08,416 --> 00:17:11,787
Even I thought she was talking about him.

211
00:17:11,787 --> 00:17:14,108
But found out later that

212
00:17:14,108 --> 00:17:17,168
She was just talking about his character.

213
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:20,199
I'm talking about his character too.

214
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,840
I found out today that he was harassing our Accounts Officer.

215
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,463
Thumbed a lift from her and tried to assault her in her car!

216
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:30,531
The blighter!

217
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,706
Look at him!

218
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:34,790
That's what the son of a priest is doing!

219
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,937
I say, throw him out!

220
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,112
So I did.

221
00:17:40,112 --> 00:17:42,863
But I'm regretting it.

222
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,704
But why?

223
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:46,324
Feel good,

224
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,114
For you did the right thing.

225
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:51,783
If the Reverend's reputation is the cause of your regret,

226
00:17:51,783 --> 00:17:53,264
Tell him when you meet him,

227
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:55,365
'<i>That</i>'s what your son's like'!

228
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,901
Only... That's not what he's like.

229
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:01,401
I feel that's not what he's like.

230
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:04,812
I've seen that type.

231
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,042
No one like that

232
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:10,451
Speaks before his boss with such firmness,

233
00:18:10,451 --> 00:18:15,079
Nor kicks away a job he got mere days before, saying, 'Please tell my father'.

234
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:19,350
'I, too, want to see how much Dad distrusts me'.

235
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,496
I've asked about her.

236
00:18:21,496 --> 00:18:27,807
Just 15 minutes ago, I got news that she was having dinner with Chengezi at a restaurant.

237
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:31,606
Chengezi is my Chief Accountant.

238
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,787
He's the one who issued the memo to him.

239
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:37,670
If that's so, why don't you reinstate him?

240
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,612
I would, but will he come back?

241
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,531
I don't think so.

242
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:07,400
This is your BA degree,

243
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,910
Your FA [A-Level] certificate,

244
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,260
And this one's for your matric [GCSEs],

245
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,836
And your character certificate.

246
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,968
Shall I massage your head?

247
00:19:23,968 --> 00:19:25,183
No.

248
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:27,093
Not today.

249
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,491
Why not?

250
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:30,143
It's this massage

251
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:32,801
That's got your grey cells working!

252
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:35,071
I need just so many grey cells to work

253
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:38,627
For me to go on like I am.

254
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,360
Aww, frustrated because you're a clerk?

255
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,656
Don't be.

256
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,271
Great men have humble beginnings.

257
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:57,366
Do you know about what Abraham Lincoln was?

258
00:19:57,366 --> 00:20:00,189
Or what Edison used to do?

259
00:20:00,189 --> 00:20:03,482
Let's talk about me, Arifa.

260
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,247
I'll never become a great man.

261
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,468
So Hazrat Sahab used to lie?

262
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:12,648
Mum tells me

263
00:20:12,648 --> 00:20:15,255
He'd seat you in his lap

264
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,699
And say, 'You'll see, Subhanallah',

265
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:21,618
'He'll grow to become a great man one day'!

266
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:25,768
Don't laugh like that.

267
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,420
Hazrat Sahab didn't lie.

268
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,096
It's just gotten into you that you can never become a great man.

269
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,158
Who's this Afzal?

270
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:56,271
That blighter?

271
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,351
Reverend Subhanallah's son?

272
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:00,076
The loafer, the vagrant!

273
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:03,611
You named him and said I love <i>him</i>!

274
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:07,021
That's what you think about me!

275
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,337
You thought you'd name anyone,

276
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:15,960
And I'd stay quiet!

277
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,816
Just because I'm in the soup?

278
00:22:17,816 --> 00:22:19,827
To the dickens with it!

279
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:22,087
I'd much rather be in the soup

280
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:29,018
Than out with the help of that loafer extraordinaire! But if you mentioned his name again, I'll claw your face apart!

281
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,576
Who is it?

282
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,716
Still angry with me?

283
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,746
Okay.

284
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:08,926
How about you slap me?

285
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:11,037
Oh, please...

286
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,528
Slap my elder sister?

287
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:16,316
The one I've taken is enough.

288
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,167
There, now.

289
00:23:18,167 --> 00:23:19,550
Sorry.

290
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,680
I promise. I won't ever slap you again.

291
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,616
Leave it be, Farah.

292
00:23:23,616 --> 00:23:25,151
Just tell me

293
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,250
Why do you despise Afzal so much?

294
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,056
I don't despise Afzal.

295
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,107
Just -- Who is he?

296
00:23:30,107 --> 00:23:32,080
He's my best friend's elder brother.

297
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,941
And you know how nice she is.

298
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:36,221
I also know

299
00:23:36,221 --> 00:23:38,387
That the Reverend is a good man.

300
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:40,398
But look at <i>him</i>!

301
00:23:40,398 --> 00:23:44,718
How can the two of us judge what someone's like?

302
00:23:44,718 --> 00:23:45,977
You'll scold me now

303
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:47,288
That I'm naming him.

304
00:23:47,288 --> 00:23:48,614
But please, try not to.

305
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:50,095
Tell me, logically speaking,

306
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,601
How can we know what someone's like

307
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:55,372
Or what one's like when we hear about them?

308
00:23:55,372 --> 00:23:57,692
I have a simple logic.

309
00:23:57,692 --> 00:23:59,551
He's nobody to me.

310
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:00,447
Yes,

311
00:24:00,447 --> 00:24:01,703
I found out two days ago

312
00:24:01,703 --> 00:24:03,916
That he works at our mill.

313
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:05,690
Okay, he's our employee.

314
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,461
A slacker, at that!

315
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:08,262
Remember?

316
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:11,532
He was out in the grounds watching a cricket match during office hours!

317
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,642
He's no longer our employee, Farah.

318
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:15,703
Dad's ousted him.

319
00:24:15,703 --> 00:24:19,757
Miss Rosy filed a complaint against him over harassment.

320
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,611
Perturbed over it, Dad was out in the courtyard for an hour.

321
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,490
Why?

322
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:29,757
Because he felt after he came home that he wasn't the culprit after all.

323
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:31,240
He was cursing himself.

324
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,426
Who told you?

325
00:24:33,426 --> 00:24:34,389
Mum.

326
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,936
She also told me he didn't have his dinner.

327
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:38,410
Then Dad does not know

328
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,510
That I saw him come out of Rosy's car with my own eyes.

329
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,090
The poor girl must've given him a lift,

330
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,287
And he would've thought he's got her head over heels for him.

331
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,556
Yes...

332
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:50,376
That may have caused the accident.

333
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:52,492
She must've been defending herself.

334
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,142
Please go and tell Dad.

335
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:56,983
Okay, I will.

336
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:59,533
And please bother to listen to anything he says.

337
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:03,983
Hey! What'll he say?
-What could a regretful man say?

338
00:25:03,983 --> 00:25:06,293
Mum said he'd apologise to him

339
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:08,363
If he could have his way.

340
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:10,994
And beg forgiveness of Reverend Subhanallah.

341
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:13,053
If that's so, why not ask him to come back?

342
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,189
Reinstate him?

343
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:16,914
He's not coming back, Farah.

344
00:25:16,914 --> 00:25:18,354
Why not?

345
00:25:18,354 --> 00:25:20,379
He's Reverend Subhanallah's son.

346
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:23,754
Kicked away the job he'd gotten on recommendation.

347
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,924
Know what,

348
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,947
When he used to gamble over matches,

349
00:25:28,947 --> 00:25:32,352
Arifa would tell me about it.

350
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:34,675
But she never said,

351
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:38,856
'My brother is the type who doesn't respect women'.

352
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:40,476
I asked once

353
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:42,497
That there must be someone he loves.

354
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:45,507
She said, 'I'm sure there's someone',

355
00:25:45,507 --> 00:25:49,157
'But he never tells anyone her name'.

356
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,630
Where's he gone?

357
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,580
To meet his friends?

358
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,830
He'll just have a little chat and come back.

359
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,991
When will he be back?

360
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:21,767
Before you go to bed.

361
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,910
Meet me somewhere else, my sweeting,

362
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,507
This pauper's presence in this princely concourse is not proper;

363
00:26:37,507 --> 00:26:43,193
For souls besotted with love to walk upon

364
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:47,508
These trails etched with the marks of regality is not proper;

365
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:51,988
This meadow on this bank of the Yamuna [holy river], this château

366
00:26:51,988 --> 00:26:56,080
These sculptured doors and walls, these arches, these niches -

367
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,546
An Emperor, by the weight of his wealth,

368
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:03,866
Has but made sport of the love of the penurious...

369
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:05,210
My sweeting,

370
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,397
Meet me somewhere else.

371
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:14,436
No.

372
00:27:15,896 --> 00:27:17,976
I won't smoke.

373
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,910
I'll have some tea.

374
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,741
Would you look at that!

375
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:10,601
It's him, isn't it? Arifa's brother?

376
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:11,632
Yeah...

377
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:13,552
But what's he doing here?

378
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:15,594
He's an A1 loafer.

379
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,603
Skiving off again, I'm sure.

380
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,276
It's him!

381
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:52,502
Who?

382
00:28:52,502 --> 00:28:54,251
Afzal!

383
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,711
Stop by the cart.

384
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,227
I'll have some of this roasted corn.

385
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:13,487
How much?

386
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,018
As much as you like!

387
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,756
Look behind us!

388
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:24,876
Is he coming?

389
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,127
Afzal?

390
00:29:26,127 --> 00:29:27,913
Of course!

391
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:28,984
No.

392
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,864
He will.

393
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,666
Here he comes!

394
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:38,497
Which way is he going?

395
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,600
The other way.

396
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,137
Did you see that?

397
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:48,576
What?
-He's not headed for our office!

398
00:29:48,576 --> 00:29:51,431
Our office is that way.

399
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,846
Listen!

400
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,722
Call him back yourself.

401
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:13,153
He may come back if you ask him.

402
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:15,123
Alright, I'll call him.

403
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:18,174
And if he doesn't come back, talk to the Reverend in the evening.

404
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,850
Get this weight off your heart.

405
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,071
If he doesn't come when I ask him, I'm not talking to the Reverend.

406
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:27,681
What difference does it make?
-It does make one.

407
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:30,416
It just struck me...

408
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:32,256
The way he said confidently,

409
00:30:32,256 --> 00:30:35,387
'Please tell my father about this'.

410
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:40,987
But now, I don't know what I'd say to his father.

411
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,087
Mr Afzal Subhanallah!

412
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,176
Come.

413
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,697
Afzal...

414
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:29,712
Subhanallah?

415
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:33,688
Yes.

416
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:37,488
Matric [GCSEs]...

417
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:40,070
FA [A-Levels] and BA...

418
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,326
Third division throughout.

419
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:45,920
But your character certificate is remarkable.

420
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,342
Third division folks...

421
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:50,506
Aren't usually so remarkable.

422
00:31:50,506 --> 00:31:53,808
How come you're so good?

423
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,590
Any experience?

424
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,747
Two days as an accountant at Ibrahim Cottons.

425
00:31:58,747 --> 00:32:00,707
Not a very good experience.

426
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:03,322
For them or for you?

427
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:04,880
For both of us.

428
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,245
Can you speak English?

429
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:10,546
I can understand what's written.

430
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,580
Speak a little, too.

431
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,526
Tell us the story of the thirsty crow.

432
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,186
Sir?

433
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:22,397
Thirsty crow, my dear chap.

434
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:23,776
Don't you remember?

435
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:27,947
'Once upon a time, there was a crow who was very thirsty'...

436
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:29,846
Do <i>you</i> know English?

437
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:30,917
What do you mean?

438
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,792
That's what I'm saying -

439
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:35,482
'What do <i>you</i> mean'?

440
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,432
I'll tell this one to my friends now -

441
00:32:41,432 --> 00:32:42,893
'There was a crow'

442
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:45,934
'Who was really hungry'.

443
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,865
Hello?

444
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,095
Am I talking to Afzal?

445
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:12,606
Yes?

446
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:14,146
Sheikh Ibrahim here.

447
00:33:14,146 --> 00:33:15,326
Peace be upon you, sir.

448
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,411
And upon you, peace.

449
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,599
Look, my dear, I realised later that it was not your fault.

450
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,326
I regret admonishing you over it.

451
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:27,346
No, sir.

452
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:29,327
There's nothing to regret.

453
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:30,487
It's okay.

454
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:33,748
I'd like you to come back.

455
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:35,803
Come and take your place at our office.

456
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:37,493
Thank you, sir.

457
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:39,994
But forgive me, sir.

458
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:43,844
It doesn't please me to take up a job on Dad's recommendation.

459
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:46,575
Perhaps you're --
-No, sir.

460
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:49,110
No 'perhaps' here.

461
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,217
Dad wanted me to get a job so I could correct my ways.

462
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:55,088
His desire has been fulfilled.

463
00:33:55,088 --> 00:33:56,877
I've corrected my ways.

464
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:59,200
I walk from place to place in search of a job now.

465
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,080
It's made me aware of my father's hardships.

466
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,039
And, in all honesty, once one has corrected his ways, he does not take up a job on recommendation.

467
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,529
Thank you very much, sir.

468
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,341
Yes, sir?

469
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,290
How many children do you have?

470
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,407
Three, sir...?

471
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,227
Two sons,

472
00:34:24,227 --> 00:34:25,403
And one daughter.

473
00:34:25,403 --> 00:34:26,818
How old is your daughter?

474
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:28,331
12, sir.

475
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:30,308
And Miss Rosy?

476
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:32,230
How many children does she have?

477
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,390
No, sir...

478
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:36,081
She's not even married.

479
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:40,110
Give Miss Rosy three months' worth of compensation,

480
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,274
And out her.

481
00:34:42,274 --> 00:34:43,370
Sir?

482
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:49,325
If you 'Sir' me again, I'll issue the same orders for you.

483
00:34:49,325 --> 00:34:51,225
Right, sir.

484
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:04,917
Promise me

485
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:07,417
You'll never mention her again,

486
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:11,358
Nor will you ask her name.

487
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:12,745
Just think as if

488
00:36:12,745 --> 00:36:15,218
There's no one...

489
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:18,350
No name...

490
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:22,180
Just... A dream...

491
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,286
That delights me when I imagine it...

492
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,026
And if this isn't acceptable either,

493
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:33,640
Go and ask for Dad's opinion on it.

494
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,779
If delighting myself with a dream is sinful,

495
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,399
I will not.

496
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,156
Don't go this way.

497
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:58,060
We go this way everyday.

498
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,540
Turn right, will you?

499
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,126
I know a shortcut.

500
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,140
Right, how's everything?

501
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,586
Fine.

502
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:19,590
Is it time for your break now?

503
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,890
It will be in a couple of minutes...

504
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,200
Have your lunch properly.

505
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,390
I will.

506
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,521
I've cleaned your room.

507
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,047
Thank you.

508
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:30,908
I...

509
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:35,334
Found the key to your cupboard.

510
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,248
Key?

511
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:43,006
Don't worry. I didn't see anything.

512
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:46,686
Where'd you find it?

513
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:49,076
Don't ask me. I didn't even have to look for it.

514
00:37:49,076 --> 00:37:51,267
That's my treasure in your possession!

515
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:54,208
That is why I stopped short of unlocking it.

516
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,479
Stopped?

517
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:58,924
I thought I'd open and read all the letters.

518
00:37:58,924 --> 00:38:00,525
But then thought...

519
00:38:00,525 --> 00:38:01,896
God's watching.

520
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,127
Please

521
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:05,658
Keep on fearing God.

522
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:09,712
Alright, bye.

523
00:38:09,712 --> 00:38:11,893
Have your lunch.

524
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:14,000
Right away...

525
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
