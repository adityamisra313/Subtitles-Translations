No.

8
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,446
I won't Dad at your work's.

9
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:50,720
I mean, I --

10
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,040
Won't work at your Dad's.

11
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,760
Who has asked you to?

12
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,891
Work for us till December.

13
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,519
For you?

14
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:02,850
It's your chance to get proper rich!

15
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,360
The designation will leave you awestruck!

16
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,627
H -- How much?

17
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,557
As much as you want!

18
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,797
I mean as much as you can think of!

19
00:03:12,797 --> 00:03:14,311
And

20
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:15,890
Designation?

21
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,991
We can decide your designation if you agree.

22
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,015
Where's your office?

23
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,286
We don't have an office.

24
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,786
What?

25
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,276
Lubna,

26
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,120
I don't want a poltroon for this job.

27
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,940
No --

28
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,269
I'm not a poltroon.

29
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:35,586
Then just say yes!

30
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:38,470
Why are you asking about our office?

31
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,921
It's all legal, isn't it?

32
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,316
No,

33
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:48,767
I mean I've promised Dad I won't do anything dodgy.

34
00:03:49,577 --> 00:03:51,178
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:52,610
'Dodgy' just slipped out...

36
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,330
Then say it firmly that you're ready!

37
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:57,941
What's with the firmness?

38
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,986
I mean,

39
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,940
Does it involve a threat to my life?

40
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,700
It may.

41
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,710
So say it plainly that you won't do it.

42
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,885
How can that be?

43
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,471
I'll put my life on the line for it!
-Good.

44
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:11,247
That's the spirit!

45
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,536
What's the job?

46
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:18,708
I'll tell you. Have something first.

47
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,919
How will I have something?

48
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,439
I'm not hungry.

49
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,490
You're lying.

50
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,470
You were opening your lunch box before my eyes!

51
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,000
No --

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,566
That was because Arifa had said...

53
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:29,967
Actually,

54
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:33,727
Arifa orders me like a mother, so I thought I'd eat.

55
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,950
I wasn't really hungry.

56
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,817
Lubna,

57
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,600
Let's talk business.

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,226
Alright, how about 200,000 a month?

59
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,210
200,000?

60
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,970
Farah will pay from her personal account,

61
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,960
Which is why you aren't getting any more.

62
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,700
And we'll give you additional allowance

63
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,867
For your dresses and all.

64
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,486
You --

65
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:59,596
You're must be kidding!

66
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:01,101
You're kidding.

67
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,390
You're pretending as if you've never seen 200,000.

68
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,247
I haven't.

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,740
I've only seen the 98,000

70
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,937
That I won in the matches.

71
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:12,733
*Hem* 'Gambling'.

72
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,110
Can you stand firm and talk to our father?

73
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,810
I can.

74
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,780
But I have great respect for him.

75
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,570
He called me today and said, 'Take your place at our office'.

76
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,530
Are you out of your mind?

77
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,630
You'd leave a job that gets you 200,000 for one that earns you 10,000?

78
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,740
No...

79
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,580
But --

80
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,705
Must I stand firm before him?

81
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,362
Is he into this business too?

82
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,757
The entire business lies in his hands.

83
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:52,117
You just have to snatch it from him for four months.

84
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,407
What are you looking for?

85
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,127
A handkerchief.

86
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,926
Thank you.

87
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,647
It's sinful to snatch the business from a father's hands...

88
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,600
Listen to the whole thing.

89
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,287
Yes?

90
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,436
I'm all ears...

91
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:32,579
The thing is, Farah's getting married to Mehtab Chawla on the 15th of December.

92
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,010
Look at me!

93
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,532
Right, so where was I?

94
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,183
Glass -- water.

95
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,111
Did you hear what I just said?

96
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,470
Y -- Yes.

97
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,627
So, Farah doesn't want to marry him.

98
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,790
But now that the date's been fixed, the situation's got a bit hairy.

99
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,920
But Farah's found a way out.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,080
She's mustered the courage to tell Dad

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,000
That she does not want to marry Mehtab

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,914
Because she loves someone else.

103
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,810
Which <i>isn't</i> quite true either.

104
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,650
She doesn't love anyone.

105
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,857
She just wants the marriage put on ice.

106
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,320
And

107
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,316
That's where you come in.

108
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,180
Come in?

109
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,300
Come in, as in, do this job.

110
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,220
What do I have to do?

111
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,049
Love Farah for four months --
-What's this balderdash!

112
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,737
I -- I mean, act as if you love her.

113
00:08:01,737 --> 00:08:04,300
Stand firm before Dad, saying,

114
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,096
'I love Farah so much that I'd die without her'!

115
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,780
Take it quietly if he wants to whack you.

116
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,817
And, if he aims his gun, say resolutely,

117
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:15,077
'Shoot me'!

118
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,362
But I can assure you

119
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:18,707
It won't come to that.

120
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,418
And even if it did,

121
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,950
His aim's nawful!

122
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,456
My aunt made it out alive, too!

123
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,160
Excuse me...

124
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,126
Why did he black out like that?

125
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:13,260
I've told you,

126
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,010
He's taken a shock.

127
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,570
What shock?

128
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,940
I'm letting him love me for four months, and I'm paying him for it! 200,000!

129
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,690
How could this ever shock a clerk earning 10,000?

130
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,020
Try to understand, Farah.

131
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,930
It's troubling him right now.

132
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,850
Why?

133
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,730
Don't forget who he is.

134
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,468
I can't forget that.

135
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:35,446
I hope you'd understand, then,

136
00:09:35,446 --> 00:09:37,656
That he thinks like the Reverend.

137
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:38,841
Meaning?

138
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,266
What does he think?

139
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:41,130
He's thinking

140
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,227
About what a girl from an honourable family is doing to one-up her father!

141
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,036
Put a sock in it!

142
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,957
It's barely days since he turned so faithful!

143
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,267
When one has newly turned faithful,

144
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:56,277
He sticks to his principles faithfully!

145
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:57,807
Anyway,

146
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,442
Don't worry.

147
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:02,840
We can find someone else.

148
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,191
What?

149
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:06,827
You want to besmirch my name everywhere!

150
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:09,068
That blighter will tell his sister.

151
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:10,800
What'll she think about me?

152
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,270
Nothing! She'll just call me

153
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,964
And ask me about it.

154
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,039
I'll just say

155
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,085
'He's lying'.

156
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:18,300
You'd better.

157
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,750
And say it in a way

158
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,360
That if the Reverend heard it, he'd break his face!

159
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,201
May I go now?

160
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,196
Where?

161
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:27,736
Sit.

162
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:31,850
And don't you dare budge from here until this smirch is washed off me!

163
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,311
Smirch?

164
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,476
Oh God...

165
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,516
Who is it?

166
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:45,872
Dad?

167
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:47,463
It's me.

168
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,796
It's you!

169
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:56,380
How come you're back so early?
-Let me get in.

170
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,726
Why are you shivering?

171
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:02,186
No idea...

172
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:04,006
Where's Mum?

173
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:06,506
She's gone to Aunt Kausar's to lustrate her child.

174
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:08,657
She'll be back soon.

175
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:11,970
Get me a quilt.

176
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,792
A quilt?

177
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:17,418
This cold is killing me...

178
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:20,122
Go to your room.

179
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,640
Take me, will you?

180
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,810
You have a fever too...

181
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,516
It's just a fever...

182
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,050
Seems like malaria.

183
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,406
No.

184
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
I don't have malaria.

185
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:54,764
I say

186
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:57,129
Go and see a doctor.

187
00:11:57,794 --> 00:11:59,570
What do I tell him?

188
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,054
For God's sake,

189
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,220
Get yourself checked up.

190
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,206
Why are you feeling so cold in the summer?

191
00:12:04,206 --> 00:12:07,482
Could it actually be malaria?

192
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:11,017
Just give me a quilt.

193
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:14,178
I'll start sweating in a moment.

194
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,021
You would, sure.

195
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,135
Okay, I'll get you one.

196
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,827
What do I have to do?

197
00:12:44,827 --> 00:12:48,690
Love Farah for four months --
-What's this balderdash!

198
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,366
I -- I mean, act as if you love her.

199
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:53,930
Stand firm before Dad, saying,

200
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,905
'I love Farah so much that I'd die without her'!

201
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,676
Here.

202
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:48,353
Quickly, now...

203
00:13:49,106 --> 00:13:51,417
I think you're fine!

204
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:53,177
Show me your hand.

205
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:56,060
The temperature's worn off...

206
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,201
Shall I turn on the fan?
-No blimming way!

207
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,490
What's with this rudeness?

208
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,561
Why'd you say that?

209
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,252
Just slipped out --

210
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:05,961
I mean, don't turn on the fan.

211
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,822
I'll start shivering again.

212
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:09,848
You've got malaria, then.

213
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,102
That's what makes you hot and cold.

214
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,000
Really...

215
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,569
It isn't malaria.

216
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,630
I swear.

217
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,296
Would you please tell me what happened?

218
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:34,791
Stay quiet, Mum!

219
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,990
Walk so that your footfalls cannot be heard!

220
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,876
Alright...

221
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,786
Come.

222
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:17,732
What happened?
-Malaria.

223
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:19,296
What?

224
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,916
It doesn't seem so...

225
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:23,970
Not me, Dad, he's got it. Afzal!

226
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,571
He's in his room wrapped in a quilt.

227
00:15:25,571 --> 00:15:26,989
A quilt?
-Yes.

228
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,830
Came back early.
-Oh?

229
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,951
I swear, Dad, he was shivering so much!

230
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:32,752
Come and see!

231
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,136
Look at him.

232
00:15:42,136 --> 00:15:45,347
He's all drenched with sweat.

233
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:48,147
Why didn't he see a doctor?

234
00:15:48,346 --> 00:15:49,930
I asked him to,

235
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,990
But he didn't agree to.

236
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,231
What's this with 'agreeing' to it?

237
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:56,957
Wake him up.

238
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,286
Everything seems alright here...

239
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,563
Get up, young man!

240
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,011
Dad?

241
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:17,576
It's you...

242
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,836
What happened?

243
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,686
Nothing.

244
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:27,516
Arifa here

245
00:16:27,516 --> 00:16:32,900
Told me you were shivering when you came back?

246
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,187
Back then, yes...

247
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:36,425
I'm fine now.

248
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:39,565
So you won't see a doctor?

249
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,810
What'd I do?

250
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,205
No shivering now... No fever too...

251
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:48,190
I hope everything's alright at the office?

252
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,610
No --

253
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,487
No problem there.

254
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,500
It's been two days since Monseigneur came for his morning prayers.

255
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,147
He doesn't usually do so when he's in town.

256
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,560
You see him around, don't you?

257
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,160
Some --

258
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,936
Sometimes, yes.

259
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,606
Alright, I say

260
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:16,047
You get some rest.

261
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,172
Prepare some yahni for him.

262
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:27,677
If he starts shivering again,

263
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:30,983
Drag him to the doctor's.

264
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,730
Call me later.

265
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,670
Yes, Dad.

266
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,940
And when will your mother be back?

267
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,211
Before sunset.

268
00:17:41,537 --> 00:17:43,507
Alright.

269
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,957
Close the door.

270
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,407
Get me some yahni, will you?

271
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,060
And yes,

272
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,876
Where's the key to the cupboard?

273
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,550
If I'm not mistaken,

274
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,356
Monseigneur's daughter

275
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:17,379
Is your friend, isn't she?

276
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,395
What's her name --?

277
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:20,719
Lubna.

278
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,620
What happened?

279
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,601
Nothing, really.

280
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,065
I'm sure she calls you?

281
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:31,350
Yes, sometimes.

282
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,316
She always asks about you.

283
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:34,636
Meh.

284
00:18:34,636 --> 00:18:40,556
Sit down for a while, so that I, too, get a feeling that I'm preparing yahni for someone who's ill.

285
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,500
Such ornate sets, Madame, that would bedazzle Farah!

286
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,080
Not a single bangle is without diamonds.

287
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,270
So you've bought everything?

288
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,499
Why not?

289
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:04,280
Bought them and had them kept in the locker.

290
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,531
We're now thinking about the dresses.

291
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:09,226
I'm looking at gold embroidery samples.

292
00:19:09,226 --> 00:19:12,027
It'll take at least 50 biscuits.

293
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,926
Biscuits?

294
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:16,766
Bars of pure gold, you know.

295
00:19:16,766 --> 00:19:18,767
We call them 'biscuits'.

296
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,673
Oh...

297
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,110
And Mehtab here said that he'd gift her a Ferrari on the wedding.

298
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,510
A Ferrari?

299
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,010
It's a bit dear, yes, but

300
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,570
Certainly not more than our Farah, is it?

301
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,771
Tell me,

302
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:35,092
What about your preparations?

303
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,051
We're just deciding...

304
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,950
Deciding?

305
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,731
Monseigneur will call you in the evening when he's back.

306
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,888
That's new.

307
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:48,900
New?

308
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,890
The men of your family talk about the wedding preparations?

309
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,932
He's

310
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:56,183
Been preparing for a few days.

311
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:58,580
He'll tell you everything today.

312
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,041
Okay.

313
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,705
I would request you, Madame...

314
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,080
Yes?

315
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,280
Ask Farah

316
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,869
To talk to Mehtab sometimes.

317
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:11,130
What's with all the shyness?

318
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,855
Why, it's only natural that --

319
00:20:13,855 --> 00:20:15,110
I mean,

320
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,945
That'll be decided tonight too.

321
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,300
Right...

322
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,399
How could I say this to Monseigneur?

323
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:25,650
God willing, it won't come to that.

324
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,726
He'll tell you everything.

325
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:30,170
Alright,

326
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,079
I'll talk to him about this too.

327
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,700
Give my love to Farah.

328
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,336
Bye.

329
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,797
Ohh...

330
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
You agreed to everything she said.

331
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,544
Not so fast.

332
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:45,150
It's just a matter of a few hours.

333
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,500
It'll all get started

334
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,191
As soon as Monseigneur calls.

335
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,880
Hey!

336
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,610
You're out here, studying peacefully,

337
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,545
While they're deciding your future!

338
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,320
Tonight, at last, you'll have to tell

339
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,475
Who he is.

340
00:21:59,475 --> 00:22:01,855
What can I do?

341
00:22:01,855 --> 00:22:04,120
Think about it and tell me his name!

342
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,910
Who do I name?

343
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,550
You suggested that blighter,

344
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,135
But he blacked out as soon as he heard it!

345
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:11,500
Purify yourself.

346
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,631
Purify?

347
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,300
It isn't time for praying yet.

348
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,266
Time for voluntary prayers.

349
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,931
Resolve to offer 100 of them.

350
00:22:17,931 --> 00:22:19,731
On your prayer mat, soldier, double time!

351
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:21,997
What are you saying?

352
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:23,732
Jeez, girl!

353
00:22:23,732 --> 00:22:26,763
When you can't find a way out yourself, ask for God's help!

354
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,093
Quickly; Mum's coming.

355
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,733
And Dad's coming in an hour too.

356
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,960
Which prayer is she offering right now?

357
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:12,106
It's time for neither the sunset one, nor the dusk one.

358
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,800
Care to tell

359
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,292
Which prayer is she offering right now?

360
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,414
Voluntary prayers.

361
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,855
She'd vowed

362
00:23:30,855 --> 00:23:33,610
To offer a hundred additional prayers if she got her wish.

363
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,655
A hundred?

364
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,861
What's her wish?

365
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:39,720
The one about Mehtab.

366
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,120
She's even taken to praying regularly that she's not married off to him.

367
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,715
She's offering additional prayers to fulfil her vow,

368
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:49,130
And Shugufta's had jewellery worth millions made.

369
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,995
And she told me that every kind of ornament

370
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:54,790
Has diamonds studded in it.

371
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,789
So how is this cause for worry?

372
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:58,660
They'll be of use to someone else.

373
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,070
When your father declines, yes...

374
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,780
<i>If</i> your father declines.

375
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,964
Why don't you just ask him?

376
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:05,230
'Please decline'!

377
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,520
Call that lad first.

378
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,820
She's not even telling me his name.

379
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,540
She'll tell you after her prayers.

380
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,230
Stop her halfway.

381
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,399
Tell her she hasn't got her wish yet.

382
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:17,760
She'll be complaining to God for nothing later on.

383
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,560
And tell her yourself

384
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,651
To be downstairs with all his details before your father arrives.

385
00:24:23,651 --> 00:24:25,570
Otherwise, it's none of my responsibility.

386
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,290
Lord, no shame in falling in love with him,

387
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,580
But now she's feeling shame in naming him!

388
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,270
How many are you done with?

389
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,455
Just 12.
-Enough.

390
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:07,491
Ask for blessings, and get back at it after the news bulletin.

391
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:09,140
Why?

392
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,030
Ask for blessings,

393
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,050
Bolt the door,

394
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,380
Sit and think who he is!

395
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,760
Dad will be trying you in an hour!

396
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,110
Dad will call to decline

397
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,156
Only if you can argue your case before him.

398
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:20,090
Or else

399
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,026
Neither your destiny, nor the date of the wedding will change.

400
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:24,431
Where are you going?

401
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:26,031
Please keep me out of it!

402
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:28,871
Your narking's fried my brains!

403
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:32,392
You could say I'd die the moment Dad would thunder.

404
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:33,740
No more help, sweetheart.

405
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,220
It's over!

406
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,635
Oui, Monsieur Mehtab?

407
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:18,096
Not Mehtab...

408
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:19,761
Afzal.

409
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,121
Hey!

410
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,947
It's you!

411
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,132
I thought you'd never come to once you were out.

412
00:26:26,132 --> 00:26:27,384
No.

413
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:28,768
I'm fine now.

414
00:26:28,768 --> 00:26:31,508
Why did you call me?

415
00:26:31,508 --> 00:26:33,743
To say yes.

416
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:35,704
Yes, as in?

417
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:40,770
The job and designation you were talking about...

418
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,940
I mean...

419
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,016
I'm in.

420
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,136
Really?

421
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,535
Would I call to lie?

422
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:54,136
You've thought about it, haven't you?

423
00:26:54,136 --> 00:26:55,896
This job means putting your life on the line.

424
00:26:55,896 --> 00:26:58,810
Dad can do anything when he's furious.

425
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,850
Please

426
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,269
Talk about Farah.

427
00:27:02,269 --> 00:27:04,270
Farah?

428
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,250
Don't you remember

429
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,631
What she said at the restaurant?

430
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:09,171
What?

431
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,881
'It may involve a threat to your life'.

432
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,580
Yes?

433
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,248
Do you think your father will kill me?

434
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:19,229
Quite possible.

435
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:20,790
Alright, then.

436
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,520
Fine by me.

437
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:25,056
I will sacrifice myself.

438
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,280
But please tell me...

439
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,980
Yes?

440
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,140
This love will go on for four months?

441
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,330
You'll have to keep it going on.

442
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,061
Will we meet, too?

443
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:41,197
Obviously, you'll get to meet us.

444
00:27:41,197 --> 00:27:44,082
But what after four months?

445
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:47,570
Do you know how much you'd earn in four months?

446
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,865
800,000.

447
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:50,090
That'd be enough.

448
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,340
Start a business with it and keep on blessing Farah.

449
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,760
The love ends there?

450
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,722
Love?

451
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,081
I mean -- the job...

452
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,650
The job ends the day Farah likes someone

453
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,640
And Dad says, 'He's the one'!

454
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,790
What about me?

455
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,120
What <i>about</i> you?

456
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,790
Dad will never agree on you.

457
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:17,510
By God, he'll create such a scene at the mention of your name --

458
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,500
Dad will create a scene, and the two of you will act your parts.

459
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,155
Farah will weep before Dad, naming you,

460
00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:25,755
And you will fall at his feet, saying,

461
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:27,840
'Uncle, I can't live without Farah'.

462
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,560
'I'd die without her; I'd take poison'!

463
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,690
Then?

464
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,660
What, then?

465
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,410
Farah will threaten him similarly.

466
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,570
Her threat will scare him for sure.

467
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,820
Won't he agree if he got scared?

468
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,160
I mean -- for his daughter...

469
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,481
But don't worry,

470
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:45,640
We've thought of a way out of that too.

471
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,650
What's the way out of that?

472
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,700
You'd two-time Farah.

473
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,460
Two-time?

474
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,969
That's what everyone will think

475
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,442
First, love her with all your heart,

476
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:58,240
And then run away a two-timer!

477
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,190
What do you mean, 'Run away'?

478
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,110
Blimey --

479
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,250
Can't you understand what I'm saying?

480
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,490
What'd a two-timer do?

481
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,330
What?

482
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,290
Leave for Karachi for a few days, my good man...

483
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,050
Change your phone number,

484
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,240
Farah will weep before Dad and say,

485
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,048
'Afzal's left me, Dad'!

486
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,479
'He's smitten with another girl'!

487
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:21,619
I swear by God, there's no one!

488
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:23,369
Who's asking <i>you</i>?

489
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:25,380
By the way, is it your Oul Wan

490
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,965
Who writes you letters?

491
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,653
Anyway,

492
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:30,660
Just think

493
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,360
Your relationship ends

494
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,480
The moment you two-time her.

495
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,130
That's it.

496
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,230
That's what she wants you to do and that's what she's paying you 800,000 for.

497
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,570
Is it too little for you?

498
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,411
It's too much.

499
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,841
The perfidious deserves not a penny.

500
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,650
Alright, I'll get back.

501
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,000
Tell her the deal's done.

502
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,874
I'll do exactly as she says.

503
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,859
Farah!

504
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,260
Farah!

505
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:49,330
If you're afraid that I may get angry on hearing his name,

506
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,751
You're mistaken.

507
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:57,540
It's okay if you love someone,

508
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,010
And I said

509
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,160
I'd reject Mehtab after meeting him.

510
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,940
Why are you getting worried?

511
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,250
Don't you think

512
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,500
I'm a liberal father?

513
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:10,917
I consider it natural to love,

514
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:14,980
As long as it does not smirch the girl's honour.

515
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,170
I --

516
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,160
I swear, Dad...

517
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,950
You don't need to swear.

518
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,760
I trust you.

519
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,940
Just tell me his name.

520
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,960
Give me his number.

521
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,880
I want to talk to him.

522
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:39,676
And I promise you that once I've talked to him, I'd call to decline Mehtab.

523
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:41,852
What's the problem with you now?

524
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:44,822
Say something; answer him!

525
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,299
Ease her a bit.

526
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,394
Even if he's a tad lower in status or rank,

527
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:54,324
Accept him.

528
00:31:54,324 --> 00:31:56,162
All of that later, Irsa.

529
00:31:56,162 --> 00:31:58,250
Let her say something.

530
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,896
Just a minute!

531
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,210
I'm sorry, Dad.

532
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,871
But if you give me a minute, she'll say everything.

533
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,152
Okay. Come and sit here.

534
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,470
Not here, Dad...

535
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,600
I'll take her along for a minute.

536
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,075
Okay.

537
00:32:26,075 --> 00:32:27,650
Take her.

538
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,542
He's neither turned tail,

539
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,580
Nor declined.

540
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,950
He's agreed.

541
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,010
He's even agreed

542
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,780
To sacrifice himself

543
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,531
If Dad would rather have his head.

544
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,680
But today, you will only mention his name.

545
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,550
You will not say he's Reverend Subhanallah's son.

546
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,883
Did he say that?

547
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:57,100
I'm saying this.

548
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,560
Start off with the sparklers

549
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,760
Before igniting the bigger bombs.

550
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
But Mum will suspect immediately.

551
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,811
She'll ask, 'Are you talking about Reverend Subhanallah's son'?

552
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:08,161
What should I do, then?

553
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,560
You've been performing well enough so far,

554
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,904
Just keep at it.

555
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:16,011
Mention his name, and come out of the room demurely.

556
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:17,840
Mum would swoon.

557
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,419
Dad would swoon, too.

558
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:21,640
But you better remain in your senses.

559
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,020
Get up the moment you name him,

560
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,020
And before they come to,

561
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,794
Slip out sharpish.

562
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,630
What's the matter now?

563
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,510
Will he come if you call him?

564
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,790
Why should I call him?

565
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,359
You call him now.

566
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,939
He'll open up when you talk to him.

567
00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:48,180
Open up, as in?

568
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,570
He'll have to open up so he can speak openly before Dad!

569
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,736
Haven't you seen

570
00:33:51,736 --> 00:33:54,700
He starts stammering when talking to you!

571
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,020
Monseigneur says that it's been a minute.

572
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,330
Go

573
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,860
And tell him quickly

574
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,971
That his name's Afzal.

575
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,410
May we talk right now?

576
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,830
Yes.

577
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:50,955
What's his name?

578
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,560
I'll only tell you his name today.

579
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,740
Alright.

580
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:58,160
Just his name today.

581
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,703
Afzal.

582
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,850
Afzal isn't his name --

583
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,860
That was a remark about his character.

584
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,370
That's his name.

585
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:15,050
It wasn't a remark about his character.

586
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,940
May I go?

587
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,971
Who's this Afzal?

588
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,290
Reverend Subhanallah's son?

589
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,860
Is he the same?

590
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,800
Tell me!

591
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,730
Answer me!

592
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,441
Is it him?

593
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,510
Yes.

594
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:03,290
It's him...

595
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:27,390
How is it that you're swooning over a lad from the neighbourhood,

596
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:30,864
And I haven't the foggiest?

597
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,910
That means

598
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,070
I've failed in my duties as a mother.

599
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,230
I told you, Mum...

600
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,139
It was just childhood feelings.

601
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,930
I realised when we grew up

602
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,561
That I love him.

603
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,680
I don't meet him.

604
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,818
Don't leave this stone unturned!

605
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,310
The thing is

606
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,630
Given the time of a year or a half,

607
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:03,781
I can correct my mistake.

608
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:07,802
How will you correct your childhood love?

609
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,920
Uhh...

610
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,300
Didn't it ever occur to you,

611
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,916
The mention of his name could kill!

612
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,397
I made a mistake...

613
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:17,888
A mistake's committed once

614
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:20,974
And never repeated again.

615
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:24,970
Now, tell me what I should do...

616
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,530
That's why I -- wasn't telling you his name...

617
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,530
His name's more than we can handle!

618
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,650
Call him tomorrow.

619
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,450
And ask him to meet me first.

620
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,470
What'll you do?

621
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,130
Let Dad meet him...

622
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,829
You want that he should say something before your Dad

623
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,940
That overwhelms his heart.

624
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,081
Traditionally, it's the mother who meets the boy first.

625
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:50,615
Alright. Call him

626
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:52,996
And ask him when he's coming.

627
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:54,321
Also, tell me

628
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:56,590
What he likes to eat.

629
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:59,120
Leave it be, Mum.

630
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,090
Just -- serve him some tea.

631
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,190
As you wish.

632
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,400
A --

633
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,371
Ask Dad

634
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,311
To call Mehtab.

635
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:10,390
Don't worry; he will.

636
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,140
Now that you're determined, everything will end up in your favour.

637
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,330
May I go now?

638
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,234
My phone's upstairs in my room...

639
00:38:20,234 --> 00:38:21,810
Go.

640
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,970
Done earwigging?

641
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,550
Shut up!

642
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
