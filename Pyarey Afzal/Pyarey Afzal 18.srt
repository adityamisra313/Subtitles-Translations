10,000 will be enough to provide both of them with food,

8
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:11,690
And we'd be making a profit of 10,000!

9
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,221
He was up to his trickery, offering the old 8,000.

10
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:17,334
I said, 'Watch who you're talking to'!

11
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:18,457
And he,

12
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:19,975
The one from Hyderabad!

13
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:21,877
I gave him a right scolding.

14
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:24,956
I even said, 'You have a bad reputation in Mam's eyes'!

15
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:27,026
'Shut your gob'!

16
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:29,209
Is he married?

17
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,750
Doesn't seem so, judging by his words,

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,157
Although someone his age should get married.

19
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:35,343
I saw him yesterday.

20
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,452
He does look lush.

21
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:39,514
So what if he looks lush?

22
00:01:39,514 --> 00:01:41,253
He's very insolent, by the way.

23
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:43,155
Took him two days to start a slanging match!

24
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:44,878
The way he addresses me with a simple 'you'!

25
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:46,435
How else should he address you?

26
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:47,404
Hey!

27
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:48,844
I'm his landlady,

28
00:01:48,844 --> 00:01:50,685
He should say 'Madam' or 'Lady' at the very least!

29
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:53,325
Seems he's from a good family.

30
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:55,220
I'll ask him this one, too.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,295
What?

32
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:59,626
'Do you come from a good family, or is it just Mam who thinks so'?

33
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:03,768
Don't you dare ask him anything like this!

34
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:06,110
Well, I can ask Babu Hamid about this too.

35
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,253
But what have we to do with his family?

36
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:13,904
As long as he quietly enjoys his food, pays us the money, and keeps fearing God!

37
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,923
Can you read it in anyone's face? About his family?

38
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:29,278
You can't, can you?

39
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:40,134
Ugh...

40
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:41,728
Potatoes and lentils again?

41
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,387
Don't worry.

42
00:02:43,387 --> 00:02:47,089
We'll get chicken on Sundays.

43
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:50,506
Enough, Salim,

44
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:51,633
Enough!

45
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:53,039
What?

46
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,001
Just -- What!?

47
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,859
Sit down.
-How many times will you ask me?

48
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:58,271
It's Saturday today.
-You already know everything!

49
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:01,134
Tell me <i>everything</i>!

50
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:04,286
Tell me!

51
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:15,681
Be honest with me,

52
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:18,514
Did he ever touch you?

53
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,136
Never!

54
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:23,717
He used to say, 'Touching besmirches love'.

55
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,920
Oh?

56
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:27,946
Blimmin' son of a saint!

57
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:32,906
And <i>you</i>! You're praising him before me!

58
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,625
The blighter's here.

59
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,657
Tell her

60
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:42,097
It's our personal matter.

61
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:46,781
She better not poke her nose in our affairs!

62
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,670
Yes, sir?

63
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,639
Why is your husband beating you?

64
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,734
Look, sir,

65
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:18,530
It is our personal matter.

66
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,337
No --

67
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:23,092
It doesn't remain personal when you scream like that.

68
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,421
Who are you?

69
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,356
I --

70
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:27,343
Live just across here

71
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:30,077
With Babu Hamid.

72
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:31,314
Please, leave,

73
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:36,549
And take it that it was my fault.

74
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,340
Listen, sir!

75
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:55,432
Yes?

76
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:58,475
Have you come from Hyderabad?

77
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:00,725
Yes?

78
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,933
Afzal, is it?

79
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,669
It is.

80
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:46,110
Hey!

81
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,723
What are you doing, Timmy?

82
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,628
Let go!

83
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:53,842
Where is he?

84
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:54,922
Who?

85
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:55,908
Afzal.

86
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:58,266
He played his last match with you.

87
00:05:58,266 --> 00:05:59,638
Match, as in, gambling.

88
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:00,905
For 100,000, no less.

89
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,304
Where'd he go after that?

90
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:03,418
Karachi.

91
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:04,984
Where in Karachi?

92
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:06,829
I don't know.

93
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:07,608
Press harder!

94
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:10,223
Seriously, Timmy, I don't know anything!

95
00:06:10,223 --> 00:06:12,523
I just dropped him at the station, that's it!

96
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:13,718
I even said, 'Don't go'!

97
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,112
But he doesn't listen to anyone, now, does he?

98
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,172
Let him go.

99
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,151
He must call you sometimes.

100
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:23,139
His phone's switched off.

101
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,089
He must've gotten a new number.

102
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,642
Go and ask his family, will you?

103
00:06:28,642 --> 00:06:30,088
I'm sure he calls them!

104
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,418
He doesn't.

105
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:33,981
The Reverend came to me.

106
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,729
Asked how everything was going,

107
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,932
But, as he left, he said,

108
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:39,339
'Does Afzal talk to you'?

109
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,792
I said, 'Not at all'.

110
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,219
'His number's switched off'.

111
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,329
He was a bit dispirited to hear this

112
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:47,512
And said, 'Ah, yes, his number's switched off'...

113
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:49,154
Go, now.

114
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:51,760
If you hear from him... Just let us know, okay?

115
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,042
Sure.

116
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:56,261
I won't keep you waiting!

117
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:21,259
Why aren't you eating anything?

118
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,742
I will if I learn.

119
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:28,944
Learn what?

120
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:31,100
Please, go on.

121
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm watching and learning

122
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,616
How one can swallow a bite like this.

123
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:48,182
Do you actually eat it, or do you just put up a pretence for me?

124
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:50,881
I'll try, too, today.

125
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:52,911
If you keep on trying,

126
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:55,351
I'll have to call the doctor.

127
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:58,558
And he charges more for coming here.

128
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:01,324
The rest is up to you.

129
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:05,318
I'd gone to Karachi two years ago.

130
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,882
I don't even remember if that blasted sea is where it used to be,

131
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:10,844
Or has it, too, skedaddled...

132
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:13,182
How far is Karachi anyway?

133
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:16,333
We can go again.

134
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:17,712
But

135
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:20,536
Where will we look for him?

136
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:23,944
The city's as large as a country.

137
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:28,849
Is it too big for a mother's heart?

138
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:35,895
I can find my son with eyes both shut, Reverend.

139
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:38,386
Alright, then.

140
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,974
Make ready to leave.

141
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:43,787
We can leave

142
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:48,162
Any day you pick.

143
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,593
But remember,

144
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:56,814
A defeated mother's son

145
00:08:56,814 --> 00:09:01,626
Can never triumph himself.

146
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:04,652
Call Arifa and ask her

147
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:06,468
To send a picture of him.

148
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:07,502
Right,

149
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:11,246
What'd <i>you</i> do with it?

150
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:15,244
Hey!

151
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,651
What'd I do with it?

152
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:19,260
We can help them.

153
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,746
How?

154
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,447
We'll run an ad on TV.

155
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:22,885
That --

156
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:26,150
'A 32-year-old has run away from home, embarrassed'.

157
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,246
With Arifa's voiceover

158
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:30,151
In a melancholic voice -

159
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,642
'Come home, my dear',

160
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:32,950
'Everyone's distressed',

161
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,309
'Dad's quietened up',

162
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,360
'Mum's not eating anything in her sorrow'.

163
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,088
You'll see,

164
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:38,653
He'll come back running!

165
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:40,184
What if he actually came?

166
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:40,903
So what?

167
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,138
May he come back with the Lord's blessings,

168
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:43,104
Stay at home,

169
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:44,701
And take care of his Mum and Dad.

170
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,390
Where will you go for your MPhil?

171
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,470
You haven't got a chance in Hyderabad.

172
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:50,120
How does that even relate

173
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,043
To me doing my MPhil?

174
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:53,231
When I said

175
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:54,447
I'm not going to London,

176
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,370
What does it mean?

177
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,872
That's what I'm asking.

178
00:10:57,872 --> 00:10:59,374
Dad will talk to me tonight.

179
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:01,860
He'll ask, 'What's Farah up to'?

180
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,409
Why would he ask you?

181
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,739
Am I dead?

182
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:06,739
Well,

183
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:08,546
Even if he wants to ask you,

184
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:09,938
Just say,

185
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:12,842
That I'm going to Karachi. Willy nilly.

186
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,437
Should I call now?

187
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:15,466
Call who?

188
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,846
Arifa.

189
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,032
Oh, right.

190
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:20,220
I'll ask the driver to get the picture from her.

191
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,892
Talk to her.

192
00:11:20,892 --> 00:11:22,734
Get the picture.

193
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:24,749
But that blighter won't come back just like that.

194
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,240
You're right.

195
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,279
He'd only come back if someone showed up at his doorstep,

196
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,048
Grabbed his collar, and said a few foul words to awaken his conscience.

197
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,529
No.

198
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,562
<i>Just</i> get a picture.

199
00:11:34,562 --> 00:11:36,607
One should keep all possible options in mind,

200
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,857
Right?

201
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:50,116
Hello?

202
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:52,709
How are you?

203
00:11:53,194 --> 00:11:55,027
I'm fine.

204
00:11:55,027 --> 00:11:57,070
And Mum and Dad?

205
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,430
Better than me.

206
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,133
Strutting about affectedly, looking at each other now and then.

207
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,211
Tell me,

208
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:05,103
Is everything alright over there?

209
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:06,865
Everything's fine, so to speak.

210
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:09,116
Farah was asking for his photograph.

211
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:10,087
Hey!

212
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,856
She'd run an ad on TV,

213
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,218
'Missing person', get it?

214
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:15,103
With your voiceover.

215
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,415
Is she mad?

216
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:18,288
Tell her he's not missing!

217
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,944
<i>She</i>'s lost him!

218
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:21,492
Alright --

219
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,413
Just give her a picture.

220
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:27,337
I know he's not missing, too.

221
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,614
May I request something?

222
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:31,381
Sure.

223
00:12:31,381 --> 00:12:35,836
You better not call me.

224
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:38,478
I have no quarrel with you, but

225
00:12:38,478 --> 00:12:42,145
It's only you or Afzal who calls me.

226
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:44,365
When you call, I get a feeling

227
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:48,114
That it's him...

228
00:12:48,114 --> 00:12:51,113
A ray of hope shines bright when the phone rings,

229
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:55,287
But gets extinguished at the sight of your name.

230
00:12:55,287 --> 00:12:56,097
Please,

231
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:58,098
Don't mind it.

232
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:01,129
You've got everything, right?

233
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:05,300
We've only got our Afzal.

234
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,926
We, his family, live in hopes of seeing his return.

235
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:11,622
Tell Farah, too -

236
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:14,154
If she started pitying people like this,

237
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:18,349
She take the Lord's affairs into her own hands.

238
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:22,411
There are many in Hyderabad who, embarrassed or vexed,

239
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:24,442
Have left their homes.

240
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:26,974
Why doesn't she worry for any of them?

241
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:31,554
The picture... It's not really about the ad...

242
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:32,512
Well, then, that's just --

243
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:35,431
Worse, innit, Lubna?

244
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:36,729
Remember,

245
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:39,589
<i>She</i> turned my brother down, pushed him away

246
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:40,929
Every single time!

247
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,991
We honoured her right to do so.

248
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,718
It's only fair that she, too, honour our right to refuse now.

249
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:56,213
I don't think she deserves so much as his picture now.

250
00:14:17,453 --> 00:14:19,060
Yes, Dad?

251
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,656
Come and sit here.

252
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,211
So what have you figured?

253
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:40,054
Have you tried getting at what's gotten into her heart?

254
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:44,445
What is she thinking of and why?

255
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:46,573
Please send her to Karachi.

256
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:48,384
And if I didn't?

257
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,651
The decision is yours to make,

258
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:53,023
But please, just let her complete.

259
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:55,261
But why is <i>she</i> vouching for <i>her</i>?

260
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,804
Because I'm with her all the time,

261
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:00,163
And I know her better than you.

262
00:15:00,163 --> 00:15:01,835
I also know

263
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:05,814
That your order will crumble before her will in but a few days.

264
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,938
So, it's better that you think about what she wants

265
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:11,211
Than getting angry with me.

266
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,837
What does she want?

267
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:18,165
The three of us must see...

268
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:19,728
Farah?

269
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:22,804
No, Dad, a psychiatrist.

270
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:26,930
You think I'm not the full shilling?

271
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,746
I would never go!

272
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,057
Why are you saying such things?

273
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,170
Just try to understand what I'm saying.

274
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,417
This girl will drive us mad.

275
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:38,170
That's right.

276
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,325
That's just what I'm saying --

277
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:43,280
Alright, I'll look for a good psychiatrist.

278
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,774
She must get treated, but will <i>she</i> go to him?

279
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:51,546
She'd say the moment she'd hear, 'You think I'm mad'?

280
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:55,446
Then, let her go to Karachi.

281
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:56,697
Not again!

282
00:15:56,697 --> 00:15:59,248
She's stumbling around in the dark within herself.

283
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,212
She wants to prove

284
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:03,089
That she just sympathises with him.

285
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,946
Who?

286
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:08,574
Afzal.

287
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:12,967
However in the blazes is Afzal related to this?

288
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,774
How is he not?

289
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,330
Just -- She's denying it...

290
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,666
Care to explain in simpler terms?

291
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,995
Tell me.

292
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:30,462
Explain like I'm unlettered and nescient!

293
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:35,389
She loves Afzal...

294
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:37,545
I don't feel the slightest of sorrow on hearing this.

295
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:40,198
But it'll grieve you to hear

296
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:42,401
That she doesn't know this herself.

297
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,311
What?

298
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,682
Whatever the dickens is she talking about, Irsa?

299
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:50,916
She's french fried my brain!

300
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:52,057
I'll take my leave.

301
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:55,090
That's what I don't like one bit about you.

302
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,640
You immerse your father in simmering hot oil, fry him into a croquette,

303
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,656
And then say, 'I'll take my leave'!

304
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:03,604
Dad, she'll think we're conniving against her.

305
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:06,638
What else are we doing?

306
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:09,308
Fair enough...

307
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,732
<i>I</i>'m seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow morning.

308
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,755
<i>I</i> need a good psychiatrist!

309
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,360
Go.

310
00:17:46,137 --> 00:17:48,949
Who shut the door to Dad's room?

311
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,744
Dad, of course.

312
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:52,533
Were you there?

313
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,202
I was coming back from there

314
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:57,259
When I saw you get out.

315
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,245
So you've heard everything!

316
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,169
Ration my rum if I understood anything except 'french fries'.

317
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:04,811
How do french fries fit in the serious conversation?

318
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,188
That's what I'm wondering.

319
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,135
Dad's lost his English, apparently.

320
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,807
He said, 'You've french fried my brain'!

321
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:14,184
Never heard that one before... 'French fried my brain'.

322
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:15,547
You don't get it.

323
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:17,447
You know how they slice potatoes to make chips?

324
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:20,448
Must be talking about that.

325
00:18:20,448 --> 00:18:21,919
But why?

326
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,669
He said it when I said,

327
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,386
'Let Farah go to Karachi'.

328
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:28,137
It doesn't sound like something

329
00:18:28,137 --> 00:18:30,322
That'd french fry his brain.

330
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:32,067
I also said,

331
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,573
'Even she doesn't know why she's going to Karachi'.

332
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,556
In other words,

333
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:37,979
You said,

334
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,698
'Farah's gone mad'?

335
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,246
I swear by God I didn't say that.

336
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:45,416
Seeing a psychiatrist doesn't mean you've gone mad.

337
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,750
Lubna?
-Just once.

338
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,703
At least it'll satisfy everyone.

339
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:52,213
Who will it satisfy except <i>you</i>?

340
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:54,263
I have no such issue.

341
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,843
But Dad's officially lost it.

342
00:18:56,843 --> 00:19:00,510
He facepalms the moment he hears what you say.

343
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,846
All of this is because of you.

344
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:06,145
You're trying to prove to Dad that I'm certifiable,

345
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,074
And telling him

346
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:13,348
That Farah's not the full shilling!

347
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:15,057
Good Lord!

348
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:16,817
I'm sure you even said

349
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:19,057
That I'm going to Karachi to look for that runagate.

350
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:19,759
There!

351
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,253
You overheard the whole thing, didn't you?

352
00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:24,364
So you actually said all of that!

353
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:26,693
Just in the flow of conversation... I said,

354
00:19:26,693 --> 00:19:29,555
'Well, it's possible'...

355
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:32,165
Oh God...

356
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:34,660
But he didn't feel the slightest of sorrow to hear this.

357
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,262
It's rather surprising, Farah,

358
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:39,990
He's usually merry as a grig at the mention of Afzal!

359
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,256
Get out.

360
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:42,222
What?

361
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,222
I said get out!

362
00:19:44,222 --> 00:19:46,253
If you poked your prating trap in my affairs again,

363
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,225
Or gave any bright ideas to Mum and Dad,

364
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:50,334
I'll kill you for real!

365
00:19:50,334 --> 00:19:51,850
Hold it, Farah.

366
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,977
You're taking everyone except yourself lightly.

367
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:55,630
People other than yourself

368
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,192
Are not marionettes;

369
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:00,053
They have never, and will never dance to your tunes.

370
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:01,383
I'm your sister,

371
00:20:01,383 --> 00:20:03,944
So I double as a psychiatrist when you need one.

372
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:07,338
But your 'madness' doesn't convince anyone!

373
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:08,681
Care to ask

374
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:10,537
What about Afzal's picture?

375
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:14,633
And what Arifa said when I asked her for one?

376
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,866
What did she say?

377
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:18,973
She said you don't even deserve his picture.

378
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:19,991
Tell me,

379
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:21,333
Do you?

380
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,067
No.

381
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,584
Not at all.

382
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:25,648
Let me give you a parting piece of advice.

383
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:27,445
Run an ad for yourself on TV,

384
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,378
'Missing person'.

385
00:20:29,378 --> 00:20:31,457
With <i>my</i> voiceover,

386
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:32,737
Tearfully saying,

387
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:34,863
'This girl is searching for herself'.

388
00:20:34,863 --> 00:20:36,504
'Please help her',

389
00:20:36,504 --> 00:20:40,083
'Or pray for her'.

390
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,057
His build looks fit.

391
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:28,729
Could you have your hair cut?

392
00:21:28,729 --> 00:21:29,682
Hair?

393
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:31,369
Why'd he need a haircut?

394
00:21:31,369 --> 00:21:35,295
Babu, boyo, I want him to look like a commando!

395
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,855
But why --
-I'm talking to Babu Hamid.

396
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:41,001
He's been scoring third division marks throughout.

397
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:45,651
With his excellent credentials, he won't get a job inside the office.

398
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:46,449
Then?

399
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:48,058
He can get one outside.

400
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,496
Outside?

401
00:21:50,496 --> 00:21:52,729
He can be a security guard.

402
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,659
His uprightness works in his favour.

403
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,639
He's the man for the job.

404
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,358
He'll earn 10,000.

405
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:00,354
Now and then,

406
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:02,807
He'd salute the toffs, open the door for them;

407
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,355
I'm sure they'll be glad to reward him.

408
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:06,199
I'm sure he'll make some 15,000.

409
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,854
Isn't it a tad too low?

410
00:22:08,854 --> 00:22:10,682
How much do you want, sir?

411
00:22:10,682 --> 00:22:13,944
1.5 million a day.

412
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:16,991
Stop laughing.

413
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:19,579
You may note it down.

414
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:23,857
One day, you'll be working as a security guard under me.

415
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,731
You have a fit build too.

416
00:22:25,731 --> 00:22:27,465
Aye, I can see a bit of your belly, but...

417
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:29,292
It'll do.

418
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:32,031
Come, Babu Hamid.

419
00:22:33,678 --> 00:22:35,524
By the way,

420
00:22:35,524 --> 00:22:37,697
This is for the tea.

421
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:42,429
Keep the change. Consider it benefaction.

422
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:53,708
What was that about 1.5 million a day?

423
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,446
Are you thinking of becoming a politician?

424
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:58,285
Nothing else would earn you so much!

425
00:22:58,285 --> 00:23:03,847
1.5 million a day, perhaps even 150 million a day.

426
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:08,718
I used to make aeroplanes like that in my younger days.

427
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:12,061
Tad would say in a lively voice, delighted, 'Mark my words, Arifa',

428
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:15,311
'My son will become a pilot one day'.

429
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,875
Arifa?

430
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:19,263
My Mam.

431
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:20,249
Hey!

432
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:22,417
My sister's name is Arifa!

433
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:25,165
Surely, your Mam's name isn't Ruqaiyya?

434
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:26,620
Yes!

435
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,623
My Mum's name is Ruqaiyya.

436
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:30,808
How do you know?

437
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:33,606
Ruqaiyya was my younger sister.

438
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:34,400
Wait...

439
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,173
'<i>Was</i>'?

440
00:23:36,173 --> 00:23:37,777
She's gone now.

441
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:39,310
My Mam, my Tad,

442
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,404
My sister, my brother...

443
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:43,069
All gone.

444
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:44,023
Where?

445
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,430
They're dead, boyo.

446
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,804
Gone.

447
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,543
All at once?

448
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:53,576
Yes.

449
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:54,469
All at once,

450
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:55,825
One night,

451
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,354
One a minute earlier,

452
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,543
Another a minute later.

453
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:00,842
They had an accident?

454
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:03,121
No accident, mun... Murder.

455
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:07,941
Four murders for one-fourth an acre of land.

456
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:10,356
Acreage, boyo, has in its nature

457
00:24:10,356 --> 00:24:12,731
A particular hunger for corpses.

458
00:24:12,731 --> 00:24:13,918
Sometimes, when it's ravenous,

459
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:16,409
It may not settle for anything under eight.

460
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:18,776
<i>Eight</i>?

461
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:20,373
But you just said four.

462
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:23,295
Four of <i>them</i> died too.

463
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,074
<i>I</i> killed them.

464
00:25:31,346 --> 00:25:33,092
Farah?

465
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:37,222
Please step aside.

466
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:39,917
Who is it, Arifa?

467
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,629
It's Farah, Mum.

468
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,553
Farah Ibrahim.

469
00:25:56,403 --> 00:26:00,415
What's my son done this time?

470
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:02,477
My dear,

471
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,874
We are no longer responsible for his words and deeds.

472
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:09,679
He's left our place.

473
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,384
When you leave for another country,

474
00:26:12,384 --> 00:26:16,708
It's their laws you live by.

475
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,349
I'm not here to talk about him, Aunt,

476
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:23,085
Nor do I have any complaint.

477
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:24,976
Right...

478
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:26,646
So you've just come...

479
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:29,695
To meet us.

480
00:26:29,695 --> 00:26:32,516
In the Lord's name [auspicious beginning].

481
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:36,654
Have Farah sit.

482
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:39,654
Ask her if she'll have tea or coffee.

483
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:44,823
Tea or coffee?

484
00:26:44,823 --> 00:26:49,014
Do I deserve coffee?

485
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:51,886
If I don't even deserve his picture,

486
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:56,294
How do I deserve to have coffee at his place?

487
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:00,496
Uh...

488
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,294
What brings you here?

489
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,765
What are you looking at down there?

490
00:27:15,765 --> 00:27:17,953
He isn't here yet.

491
00:27:17,953 --> 00:27:20,265
So what? Big deal.

492
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:23,070
Why are you worried so much about him?

493
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,831
I'm not worried about him.

494
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:27,614
I've been thinking about lunch.

495
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:30,549
If he didn't have lunch, he'd say when the month's over,

496
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,410
'No lunch, no money'!

497
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,579
Why wouldn't he?

498
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:37,665
We cooked the food for <i>him</i>, right?

499
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,615
Anyway, mind yourself when you lean.

500
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:42,828
It's a long way down.

501
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:48,157
He's here, Mam!

502
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:50,641
Serve him food.

503
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,735
That one seems to be his room.

504
00:28:06,735 --> 00:28:07,611
Yes.

505
00:28:07,611 --> 00:28:09,658
It is.

506
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:12,314
Why have you locked it?

507
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:17,456
Mum has a feeling he's in his room when it's not locked.

508
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:19,533
Oh...

509
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,744
He's done a BA, right?

510
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:27,193
Third division throughout?

511
00:28:27,193 --> 00:28:29,648
What kind of job will he get with that?

512
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:31,820
I mean, he had a chance in Hyderabad, you know...

513
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,507
Quite a few bigwigs around here know Uncle, too.

514
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,883
Who'd want him in Karachi?

515
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,428
Mark my words,

516
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:42,308
He'll end up in bad company.

517
00:28:42,308 --> 00:28:44,351
God will help him.

518
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:45,319
God will,

519
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,227
But only if he does something too.

520
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,821
He could've done an MA.

521
00:28:48,821 --> 00:28:49,786
Maybe

522
00:28:49,786 --> 00:28:51,635
He could've done better?

523
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:54,288
He's done with his studies, Farah.

524
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:56,744
Anyway... That's his personal matter.

525
00:28:56,744 --> 00:29:00,663
But there's no wisdom in it.

526
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:11,266
I figure he must've left a letter?

527
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,936
Yes.

528
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:17,297
He has one for theatrics, I'd give him that!

529
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,764
What'd he say?

530
00:29:20,764 --> 00:29:24,548
The letter is also his personal matter, innit?

531
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:25,922
Ah, yes...

532
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:27,829
Sorry...

533
00:29:28,328 --> 00:29:29,766
Anyway,

534
00:29:29,766 --> 00:29:31,409
He wrote,

535
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:34,551
'I'm not coming back until I've become something'.

536
00:29:34,551 --> 00:29:36,453
But I wonder what...

537
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:37,142
I mean --

538
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,658
Surely, he must've thought of something?

539
00:29:40,658 --> 00:29:43,287
He never got the opportunity to think.

540
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:46,798
He'd be thinking now.

541
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,001
Honestly,

542
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:57,565
You don't blame me, do you?

543
00:29:57,565 --> 00:30:00,094
Uncle Reverend surely wouldn't,

544
00:30:00,094 --> 00:30:01,990
But your Mum...

545
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,267
Perhaps she thinks he left because of me?

546
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:07,924
No --

547
00:30:07,924 --> 00:30:09,064
Tell me...

548
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:10,829
It won't hurt me.

549
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:14,298
I, too, feel that it was my fault.

550
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:16,993
What's your fault?

551
00:30:16,993 --> 00:30:17,735
When I'd --

552
00:30:17,735 --> 00:30:19,663
Brought his letters

553
00:30:19,663 --> 00:30:22,379
Before your Mum and Dad...

554
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:25,221
Why'd I have to say any of that?

555
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:26,298
I could've just called you

556
00:30:26,298 --> 00:30:27,299
And said,

557
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,174
'I swear by God',

558
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:30,519
'I haven't written those letters'.

559
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,176
Yes.

560
00:30:32,176 --> 00:30:33,535
You could have...

561
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:34,688
But <i>you</i>!

562
00:30:34,688 --> 00:30:37,212
You barged into my house and created a scene!

563
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:40,316
I was furious!

564
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:42,517
Everything happens for the better, Farah.

565
00:30:42,517 --> 00:30:44,204
Hollow sayings!

566
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:45,489
Nothing bad

567
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:46,989
Ever happens for the better.

568
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:51,190
What's so bad for you?

569
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,727
Wouldn't it hurt me?

570
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:02,903
I mean -- Your Mum and Dad --

571
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,619
My heart sinks to think of them.

572
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:09,071
I feel as if I've committed a grave sin.

573
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:11,461
You haven't sinned.

574
00:31:11,461 --> 00:31:14,980
An honourable and virtuous girl should do just what you did.

575
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,557
Innit?

576
00:31:16,557 --> 00:31:20,541
You shouldn't regret this either.

577
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,712
Afzal's my brother, but

578
00:31:22,712 --> 00:31:25,990
He wasn't being fair on you.

579
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,287
It's certainly wracked our hearts with grief that he's left,

580
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:34,036
But so has the fact that he's two-timing a girl.

581
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:36,817
Who?

582
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:38,678
The one who writes him letters.

583
00:31:38,678 --> 00:31:39,664
Ah, right!

584
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,964
The other Farah!

585
00:31:40,964 --> 00:31:42,616
I forgot her entirely!

586
00:31:42,616 --> 00:31:43,774
Find out, Arifa,

587
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:44,475
Who she is,

588
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:47,882
What she does, and where she lives.

589
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:50,256
It's no use.

590
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:52,130
Why?

591
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,118
She can help us bring Afzal back.

592
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:57,302
How will that poor lass help us?

593
00:31:57,302 --> 00:31:59,147
Her own love is at stake.

594
00:31:59,147 --> 00:32:02,642
She'd have Afzal's new number!

595
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:03,774
Right!

596
00:32:03,774 --> 00:32:07,226
I'm sure he calls her!

597
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,585
No?

598
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:10,356
I don't think he does.

599
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:12,521
That's why she writes letters.

600
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:14,227
I'm sure he writes to her too?

601
00:32:14,227 --> 00:32:17,368
I mean, at least replying to her?

602
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,636
Perhaps.

603
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,432
'Perhaps'?

604
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:23,069
Obviously, he replies; That's why she writes to him!

605
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:24,275
She isn't mad,

606
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,539
To just keep on writing herself.

607
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:29,302
The most bizarre things can happen in love

608
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:32,022
That would never happen in sensibility.

609
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,287
Look, now,

610
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,133
At how you, in your senses, said it,

611
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,491
'The road ahead is yours alone, Monsieur',

612
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,194
'I have no ties with you'.

613
00:32:38,194 --> 00:32:40,038
It ended there.

614
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:41,958
Now, if someone's ready to sacrifice his life for you,

615
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,799
But you have no ties with him,

616
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,037
What does it matter to you if he

617
00:32:47,037 --> 00:32:51,048
Goes to Karachi or the wops?

618
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,424
Right...

619
00:32:54,424 --> 00:32:56,944
You're right there.

620
00:32:56,944 --> 00:32:59,211
But --
-What's with this 'but'

621
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,791
If I'm right?

622
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:04,598
Just pray that he becomes something and comes back,

623
00:33:04,598 --> 00:33:06,974
And tells us who it is that writes him letters,

624
00:33:06,974 --> 00:33:08,663
What she does, where she lives;

625
00:33:08,663 --> 00:33:11,535
I'm sure I can convince Mum and Dad.

626
00:33:11,535 --> 00:33:13,910
'Convince'?

627
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,428
Simple.

628
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:18,892
I'll get them married, of course.

629
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,321
Yeah, right...

630
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:24,334
They should get married...

631
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:34,103
It's almost evening, Arifa.

632
00:33:34,103 --> 00:33:35,568
I'll take my leave.

633
00:33:35,568 --> 00:33:37,690
You'd come again, wouldn't you?

634
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,331
Sure, why not?

635
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:42,956
I'll come again, if the Lord wills.

636
00:34:06,151 --> 00:34:08,646
Why are you laughing?

637
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,569
Your brother's left home and gone,

638
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:14,364
And you're giggling gleefully!

639
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:16,427
No, Mum,

640
00:34:16,427 --> 00:34:19,085
I'm tearing up to think of that poor Farah.

641
00:34:19,085 --> 00:34:21,130
Which one?

642
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,692
The one who just left,

643
00:34:22,692 --> 00:34:24,771
Or the one who never came?

644
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,692
How does <i>she</i> come in?

645
00:34:26,692 --> 00:34:29,833
She'd come in if she were ever there.
-What?

646
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:34,584
Who wrote the letters, if she were never there?

647
00:34:34,584 --> 00:34:35,974
Look,

648
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,384
I'm very restless to begin with,

649
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:42,536
Please don't give me new fears.

650
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:44,898
Fear the one who just left.

651
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:48,741
Don't think about the one who was never here.

652
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:51,817
I dread her already.

653
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,101
She's come here twice,

654
00:34:53,101 --> 00:34:57,870
And left us clobbered each time.

655
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,340
O God, have mercy.

656
00:35:05,168 --> 00:35:07,462
Does this lad not work?

657
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:08,980
Who?

658
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,227
What's his name --?

659
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:12,575
Afzal?

660
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,639
Yes, Afzal.

661
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,836
I'm sure he does.

662
00:35:15,836 --> 00:35:18,789
What's it to us, though?

663
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,946
Where does he get the money from?

664
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:22,045
Now,

665
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:24,509
He's paid the rent for four months.

666
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:25,212
And,

667
00:35:25,212 --> 00:35:27,538
On top of that, he's paid 10,000 in advance for his food.

668
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:29,682
How's he paying for everything?

669
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:31,179
Enjoy your mangoes, Mam,

670
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:32,916
Don't worry about the trees. [Mind your own business]

671
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:34,257
Yeah,

672
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:38,650
But we better check they're mango trees alright.

673
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,610
Not gonna lie to you, though, he's good.

674
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,454
He's upright and doesn't look the wrong way.

675
00:35:43,454 --> 00:35:45,020
He seems the mim and modest type.

676
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,718
He's just a tad lippy.

677
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,453
Well, so are you...

678
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:50,436
Ruffling everyone's feathers like you do!

679
00:35:50,436 --> 00:35:54,205
If I'm not lippy, these men would eat me alive!

680
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:57,908
To add to it, I'm rather comely.

681
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:04,333
What? Ain't I?

682
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,210
But of course you are, Jasmine,

683
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,110
But please don't say it yourself!

684
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,286
Should I serve dinner?

685
00:36:14,286 --> 00:36:15,506
Go.

686
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,395
But please don't start prattling.

687
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,335
Aren't you afraid?

688
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:40,099
The police will find you one day.

689
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:44,631
Have you ever thought what'd happen then?

690
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:46,763
What's the worst they can do?

691
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,356
Throw me in the quod,

692
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:50,215
Send me to the gallows?

693
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:52,579
That it? Let them, boyo.

694
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:57,573
Let the fifth die...

695
00:36:57,573 --> 00:36:58,888
Oh?

696
00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:01,094
So why are you in hiding?

697
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,855
Go and face them,

698
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:06,090
Tell them you're ready to die.

699
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,875
I'm not ready to die just yet.

700
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,011
I'm not afraid of dying,

701
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:14,245
But I want to live on.

702
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:17,434
There.

703
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:18,648
Go and open the door.

704
00:37:18,648 --> 00:37:21,572
The Reaper has come knocking.

705
00:37:27,553 --> 00:37:29,020
Get out of the way.

706
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,541
And don't stare like that.

707
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,226
You could try asking for food yourself sometime, Babu Hamid,

708
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:35,713
Or is it that you folks don't feel hungry at all?

709
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,333
Never had to come to that.

710
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,207
You're here

711
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:42,505
Whenever we feel a bit of hunger.

712
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:44,177
Potatoes and lentils again?

713
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:45,744
Where's the potatoes?

714
00:37:45,744 --> 00:37:50,644
Are you blind or do they call okras potatoes in Hyderabad?

715
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:51,992
Keep it there.

716
00:37:51,992 --> 00:37:55,088
Sure.

717
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,044
You better know your limits.

718
00:38:01,044 --> 00:38:03,086
Don't think of me as une femme frêle.

719
00:38:03,086 --> 00:38:05,396
For the likes of you, I can be a ferocious wildcat.

720
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:08,792
I claw the faces of the insolent!

721
00:38:08,792 --> 00:38:09,676
Hmm...

722
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:11,992
Good that you mentioned it.

723
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:14,961
I'd been thinking you're a girl for 20 days.

724
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:15,896
By the way,

725
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:18,133
What do I do to make you leave?

726
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:19,756
What?

727
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,817
Will you leave if I meow you?

728
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:22,819
No way, that's --

729
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:24,794
A catca -- how you call a cat.

730
00:38:24,794 --> 00:38:25,539
So,

731
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:29,647
What do you say to shoo one away?

732
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:31,849
Bleedin' dog!

733
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,650
C'mon, mate.

734
00:38:40,905 --> 00:38:42,496
Have your dinner.

735
00:38:42,496 --> 00:38:44,203
I'm starving.

736
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:47,264
That wasn't right, Afzal.

737
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:49,854
What?

738
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:54,888
The punishment for breaking a heart is worse than gibbeting.

739
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:58,469
Fear it.

740
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,338
Come.

741
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:28,213
I've seen you.

742
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,200
Who is it?

743
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:48,692
Who is it?
-Afzal.

744
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:50,312
What are you doing here?

745
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:51,436
I'd

746
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:54,692
Come to return the utensils.

747
00:40:00,921 --> 00:40:03,409
You came through here?

748
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:04,964
Yes.

749
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,576
I think you don't know

750
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:10,484
But as per the rental agreement, you're not allowed to open this door.

751
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:11,578
Anyway,

752
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,671
We'll talk about it in the morning.

753
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:14,718
Listen.

754
00:40:14,718 --> 00:40:16,862
It's not Babu Hamid's fault.

755
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:19,106
He went to bed right after dinner.

756
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:20,355
I --

757
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:23,231
Thought this door leads to your place, so...

758
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:26,216
I came here on the pretext of handing you the utensils.

759
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:28,059
Pretext?

760
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,021
No, it's --

761
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:31,169
Babu Hamid thinks

762
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:33,513
I've broken your heart.

763
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,981
I couldn't fall asleep.

764
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:38,674
We don't have sleeping pills --

765
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:40,969
I'm not asking for a pill...

766
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:44,309
I'm asking forgiveness...

767
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,761
That's neat.

768
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:48,575
You're a right emotional man.

769
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:50,872
Does this apology come from your heart,

770
00:40:50,872 --> 00:40:53,449
Or are you just apologising to impress me?

771
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:55,277
Why would I impress you?

772
00:40:55,277 --> 00:40:56,871
I know this one!

773
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,653
You lost your heart to a comely lady,

774
00:40:58,653 --> 00:40:59,937
So acted rough at first,

775
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:01,724
Then impressed her with an apology.

776
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:04,138
It won't be so easy with me!

777
00:41:04,138 --> 00:41:04,669
I've --

778
00:41:04,669 --> 00:41:06,013
Just come to apologise.

779
00:41:06,013 --> 00:41:09,809
Not to impress you...

780
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,090
Alright, then.

781
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,529
It's okay.

782
00:41:18,529 --> 00:41:19,338
Thank you.

783
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:21,495
You're welcome.

784
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
