7
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,885
I'm afraid.

8
00:01:19,396 --> 00:01:21,681
Good.

9
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,256
What do you mean?

10
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:26,670
You're saying it's good that I'm afraid?

11
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,840
Do you know why I'm afraid?

12
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,480
Yes.

13
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,540
You're afraid he's married the Farah from the letters,

14
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,590
And you think he'd come back from Karachi

15
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,000
With two kids.

16
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,477
You're also afraid

17
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:47,377
That they would recognise you instantly,

18
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:50,250
And run to embrace their 'Aunt'.

19
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,900
Why would they embrace me?

20
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,076
And how'd they know me?

21
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,940
Farah,

22
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,336
One never forgets

23
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:03,096
The one who wounds him.

24
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:05,486
So, your name would be mentioned often

25
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:08,827
Before Farah and the kids.

26
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:10,677
There!

27
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,576
You're getting goosebumps, aren't you?

28
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,920
Do you know what that means?

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,456
What?

30
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:17,040
Well,

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,704
You know it very well.

32
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:23,401
You're wishing that you die before seeing that day.

33
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,511
Which day?

34
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,642
C'mon, mate, don't act so innocent.

35
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:29,123
One gets the chills when one's so perturbed.

36
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,172
God forgive...

37
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:31,983
However did you even think that

38
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,076
He'd marry the Farah from the letters,

39
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:36,580
And he'd have two kids who'd - God forbid -

40
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,833
Call you 'Aunt' the moment they see you?

41
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:39,767
Out!

42
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:40,547
Think again,

43
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:41,567
I'd actually leave.

44
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:44,877
Remember how you'd pleaded with me to get me here?

45
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:47,390
<i>I</i>'m not my problem; <i>you</i> are!

46
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,470
I'm seeing the psychiatrist in the morning because of you.

47
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,269
Dad's booked an appointment in the evening too.

48
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:56,096
What happened to him?

49
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,607
I told you...

50
00:02:57,607 --> 00:03:00,120
He thinks his brain's been french fried.

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,680
He's fine.

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,987
That's just a problem with his English.

53
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,396
You're laughing, aren't you?

54
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,067
Wait,

55
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,178
I may just curse you!

56
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,318
Hey!

57
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,050
I'll say,

58
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,946
'May you be in my condition',

59
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,410
'Stumbling around restlessly',

60
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,710
'Living, but not alive',

61
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,680
'Mortified, but not quite dead'!

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,931
Oh...

63
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:25,362
So that's how you're feeling...

64
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,072
And

65
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,849
YOu never even told me!

66
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,222
I'm telling you now.

67
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,092
Cursing you, too.

68
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:32,753
Thank you, Farah.

69
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,263
You're thanking me now,

70
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:36,323
But you'll get your deserts later.

71
00:03:36,323 --> 00:03:37,543
That's what they all say -

72
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,453
'You'll get your deserts when you fall in love'.

73
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,964
But this knave called 'love' never got me!

74
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:45,050
Who's talking about love?

75
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,256
You're bubbling with love head to toe,

76
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:50,016
And asking who's talking about love!

77
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:51,606
By the Lord, lassie,

78
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:56,046
However do I tell you I don't love him!

79
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:58,707
I'm even sad

80
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,768
About not marrying Mehtab.

81
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:03,887
I dragged principles in for no reason,

82
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:05,767
Otherwise, he was right -

83
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:09,371
Who goes to London to study after getting married?

84
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:10,870
Should I call him?

85
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,862
Mehtab?

86
00:04:11,862 --> 00:04:12,990
Of course.

87
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,517
The poor lad would've gotten up.

88
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:17,176
He'd be shivering right now.

89
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:19,050
May the Lord keep him happy.

90
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,926
Hey!

91
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,326
Why are you throwing your responsibility onto the Lord?

92
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,927
If you've realised your mistake, just call him.

93
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:27,967
Marry him, take him to London. Keep him happy.

94
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,517
I'll meet him when I go to Karachi.

95
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,790
Oh...

96
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,610
So you're going to Karachi?

97
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,557
Might as well.

98
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,347
If I understood what Mehtab said,

99
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:40,048
I'd definitely go to Karachi.

100
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,298
Why are you laughing?

101
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,576
For God's sake, Farah,

102
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:51,150
You'd follow Afzal to Timbuctoo if he went there.

103
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,326
I mean,

104
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:55,036
You've started respecting Mehtab for him. Wow...

105
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:55,942
Lubna!

106
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:57,377
You better leave.

107
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,700
Oh, please!

108
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,205
You'd be left afraid and alone here if I went away.

109
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:03,267
I won't be afraid.

110
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:06,010
Think over it, Farah Ibrahim,

111
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,500
You're taking a risk.

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,097
I know very well -

113
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:11,458
Lost love becomes a ghost

114
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,559
That comes back to haunt you.

115
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,168
Who?

116
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:19,030
Afzal, of course.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,770
C'mon,

118
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,267
Get out!

119
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,320
Okay, fine.

120
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,857
Close the doors and windows.

121
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:30,233
Although doors and windows do little to deter ghosts,

122
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:32,303
It just satisfies one's heart.

123
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:33,100
Okay?

124
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,070
Good night.
-[Call to the morning prayer]

125
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,869
[Call to the morning prayer]
-Oh, sorry...

126
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,080
[Call to the morning prayer]
-Good morning.

127
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:57,947
[Call to the morning prayer]

128
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,040
You've kept God busy, Ruqaiyya Begum.

129
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,897
He

130
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:17,617
Looks after everyone's children.

131
00:06:17,617 --> 00:06:20,647
He will take care of your son, too.

132
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,667
Don't worry.

133
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,220
He'd better.

134
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,641
There's no power but God's!

135
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,826
This 'He'd better' part isn't exactly...

136
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:38,063
Proper.

137
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:43,791
You coming between the Lord and me is not proper either, Reverend.

138
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,111
Please be kind enough

139
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:49,051
As to leave the Lord with His woman,

140
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:52,121
Beyond the Reverend's control.

141
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,594
Whatever are you saying,

142
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,225
Ruqaiyya Begum?

143
00:06:57,225 --> 00:07:00,156
What could I do, Reverend?

144
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,070
A mother's courage is most unlike that of the Lord.

145
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,070
Nothing that's His ever gets lost,

146
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,651
But mothers' sons do get lost.

147
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:23,370
That's why I've been chanting requests -

148
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,550
'If You remember Your love for Your Creation',

149
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,620
'Don't ever forget a mother's love for her son'.
-God forgive!

150
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,781
Does He ever forget?

151
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,602
Exactly.

152
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,462
That's what I'm asking.

153
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,580
'Did You forget it when it was my turn'?

154
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,410
Your mother's saying words of disbelief!

155
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,300
There's never disbelief in a mother's words, Dad.

156
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,140
The one who gives birth to children is talking to the One who gave birth to all of Creation.

157
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,353
I'm sure she knows how to talk.

158
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,980
Is it that the two of you leave me speechless now,

159
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,325
Or is it that the one who's left

160
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:35,216
Has taken my words with him?

161
00:08:35,216 --> 00:08:40,100
But remember, Ruqaiyya Begum,

162
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,590
If there's so much as a speck on the honour of God's men,

163
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,020
Miracles happen.

164
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,197
Listen, Reverend,

165
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,600
Mothers pray for miracles in their helplessness.

166
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,910
It's an obligation on God's men to do something worth showing Him.

167
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,927
Then save your prayers.

168
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:03,260
Every day, to do something worth showing,

169
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,064
I go to watch cricket.

170
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:09,990
I spend the entire afternoon there,

171
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,546
At the playground where your Afzal

172
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:16,521
Used to play matches he'd gamble over.

173
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,604
If I got wind of his whereabouts,

174
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:24,440
I'd rush to his doorstep that instant.

175
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,370
And...

176
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,260
Don't be so selfish in your sorrow

177
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,797
As to forget the pain of Afzal's father.

178
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:41,170
Just think

179
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,280
You're tormented in one way,

180
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,947
And I'm tormented in another.

181
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,896
Arifa!

182
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:56,217
Come and shut the door.

183
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:59,480
It's time

184
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,290
For the Reverend to do his fatherly duties.

185
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,520
What --

186
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,999
What's up with the people?

187
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,410
Why are they saluting me?

188
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,800
Why are they calling me 'Afzal Bhai'?
-The cowards are so helpless --

189
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,610
The cowards are so helpless --
-Peace be upon you, Afzal Bhai!

190
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,550
How are you, sir? Would you like to have some tea, sir? A cold drink?
-I'm fine.

191
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,200
No, thank you very much.

192
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,920
Okay, sir.

193
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,790
That's how they talk to their oul fella.

194
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,740
Whatever does that mean?

195
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,340
Why are you so tensed? If they salute you, just greet them back.
-But --

196
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,440
Why now? They never used to.

197
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,800
And I didn't quite get this one about the oul fella and 'Bhai'.

198
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,711
Alright, come. I'll tell you.

199
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,930
How are you?
-I'm fine.

200
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,410
Greetings, sir! How are you?

201
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,980
Go on.

202
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,905
Tell me.

203
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,900
What do these sudden salutes mean?

204
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,186
Why were they calling me 'Afzal Bhai'?

205
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:43,910
Sit.

206
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,721
Cripes, mate...

207
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:49,691
Be done with this chapter of 'sit', 'stand up', 'I'll tell you at home'.

208
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:52,104
Just get to the point.

209
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:54,508
How tall are you?

210
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:56,688
You're asking about my height?

211
00:12:56,688 --> 00:13:00,389
Just tell me how tall you are; I'll answer your question.

212
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:03,114
5' 11".

213
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,901
5' 11"...

214
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:05,931
Weight?

215
00:13:05,931 --> 00:13:07,341
Again?

216
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:09,105
Tell me your weight.

217
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:11,036
81 kg.

218
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,649
Now, look around and tell me how many lads

219
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,950
Are above 5' 11"

220
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,430
And 81 kg.

221
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,390
You'd find more than a handful.

222
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,730
They all lived here,

223
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,292
Yet, before you came,

224
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:37,370
Why did girls have to fear for their honour

225
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,240
Before a 5' 11" hoodlum like yourself?

226
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,610
Because measuring a man's height and weight tells nothing about how much courage he's got.

227
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,180
Hoodlums are not made by their capabilities,

228
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,440
But by the fear and cowardice in the hearts of people.

229
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,040
The one they fear

230
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,483
Becomes a hoodlum.

231
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,910
Tell me about the salutes.

232
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,811
Why were they saluting me?

233
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:14,246
The people have begun to fear you because they think you're a bigger hoodlum than Wali.

234
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:15,797
What?

235
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:21,990
One surprised 'What' isn't going to change the ways of the city.
-Here.

236
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,410
Here's your lunch.

237
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,680
So much?

238
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,005
It's nothing much, really.

239
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,356
Just many dishes.

240
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,262
What've you got?

241
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,946
Potato, meat, chicken ginger, and mixed vegetable.

242
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,156
Why are you looking at each other?

243
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:46,403
Try it and tell me how it is.

244
00:14:46,403 --> 00:14:48,560
I've cooked the chicken ginger.

245
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,026
Yes, it's good. Good.

246
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,720
You haven't even tasted it!

247
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,290
It sure looks good!

248
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,940
When did you see it?

249
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,310
There's a lid on the top.

250
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,652
I can see it on your face! The chicken ginger sure is delicious!
-There, now!

251
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,490
And what are you doing, looking at me like that?

252
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,011
Just a spot of lipstick's got you stunned!

253
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:17,763
Well,

254
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:20,290
That isn't something I could say myself.

255
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,530
Mam's told me not to.

256
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,881
How say you tell me -

257
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,521
How does this lipstick look?

258
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,655
It -- I -- It's good.

259
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,461
So you think you've been sent here as part of a conspiracy against you,

260
00:15:56,461 --> 00:15:59,393
And you're otherwise perfectly normal.
-Of course.

261
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:00,425
Know what,

262
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,787
I'm the first girl in my family

263
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:06,002
Who's seeing a psychiatrist for her treatment.

264
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:07,280
Do you know why?

265
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,564
Why?

266
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:11,844
Because they think of psychiatrists as shrinks and aliénistes in my family!

267
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:13,290
Aye?

268
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,450
'Aye' as in?

269
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,913
Is it right?

270
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:18,950
Naw at all!

271
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:20,860
So,

272
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,270
You were saying

273
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,200
That Lubna's your younger sister?

274
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,850
Yes.

275
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,550
And who's this Afzal?

276
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,969
Afzal?

277
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:32,970
I didn't even mention his name.

278
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,561
Hold on!

279
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:37,572
You've been briefed before I came here.

280
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:42,512
Naw at all, you've named him five times in twenty minutes.

281
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,033
How could that be?

282
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:48,026
I shut up even so much as a thought of him.

283
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:49,560
Why do you think of him?

284
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,330
I mean, who is he to you?

285
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,292
Hold your horses, Monsieur le Docteur!

286
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,350
He's nobody to me!

287
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,230
Lubna's best friend is Arifa,

288
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,503
And he's her brother.

289
00:16:58,503 --> 00:17:01,219
An ace loafer and wastrel.

290
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:02,440
Just last month

291
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,940
He gambled one last time

292
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,987
And ran away from the city.

293
00:17:05,987 --> 00:17:07,120
Oh!

294
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,340
Where'd he go?

295
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,490
No idea.

296
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,821
But I hear he's gone to Karachi.

297
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:15,796
I also know why he's gone there.

298
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,494
Why?

299
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:21,331
Don't you think it's

300
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,682
Something I have nothing to do with?

301
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:25,133
Aye, right, you don't,

302
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,292
But...

303
00:17:26,292 --> 00:17:30,403
I thought I might as well ask now that you've mentioned it.

304
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:32,883
He's having an affair with a girl.

305
00:17:32,883 --> 00:17:35,426
He's eloped with her, I'm sure.

306
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:38,690
Want to know her name?

307
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,270
Yes?

308
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,300
You'd laugh.

309
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,091
Naw,

310
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:45,186
I promise.

311
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:48,591
Farah!

312
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:52,436
That blighter's name is Farah, too!

313
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:55,401
His parents are very sad...

314
00:17:55,401 --> 00:17:58,128
It pains me to see them.

315
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:00,059
So, you pay them a visit now and then?

316
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,770
No, Monsieur le Docteur!

317
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,245
It's nothing like that.

318
00:18:04,245 --> 00:18:06,410
I just felt, for once,

319
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,085
That I'm partly to blame for his leaving, too.

320
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,290
So, I went over to comfort them.

321
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,889
Why did you feel so?

322
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,770
I mean, if you shut up so much as a thought of him,

323
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,912
How could you be responsible for his leaving?

324
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:20,771
Leave it be, Monsieur le Docteur.

325
00:18:20,771 --> 00:18:22,871
It's a long story...

326
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:27,396
We've got plenty of time; I can listen to long stories.

327
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:29,101
I think

328
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,503
It's quite personal.

329
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:33,252
Look,

330
00:18:33,252 --> 00:18:36,203
Nothing's personal when seeing a psychiatrist.

331
00:18:36,203 --> 00:18:39,640
Everything the patient tells is strictly confidential.

332
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,815
'Patient'?

333
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,570
You're calling me your patient?

334
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,490
Uh -- Naw -- It was a slip of the tongue...

335
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,760
I meant,

336
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,100
We call those who consult us for advice our patients.

337
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,010
Oh...

338
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,300
Don't call me a patient again, though, okay?

339
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,491
Sure.

340
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:54,261
Right.

341
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,176
The story begins

342
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,132
With Mum getting me engaged to one Mehtab.

343
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,526
The lad's a proper bounder.

344
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:03,110
I agreed to it in the beginning,

345
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,714
But when I interviewed him after the engagement,

346
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:06,969
I realised

347
00:19:06,969 --> 00:19:07,690
That --

348
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,830
His intentions aren't right!

349
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,330
What were his intentions?

350
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,640
Well,

351
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,790
I won't tell you everything.

352
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,280
Just think

353
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,750
That he had no intention to work even after getting married.

354
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,661
How'd he get his two square meals if he didn't work?

355
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,432
He has no issues with that.

356
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,242
He's got millions lying in the bank,

357
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:30,923
And he gets his share from that.

358
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:31,972
But I

359
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:33,998
Curse a lad like that,

360
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:35,890
Who'd keep millions in a vault

361
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,281
And make a show of having a jolly good time before the poorer ones!

362
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:41,581
You don't look like you're among the 'poorer ones'.

363
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,801
What do you mean, Monsieur le Docteur?

364
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,031
My Dad doesn't like wasting money,

365
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:48,171
But he could buy the likes of Mehtab in a moment.

366
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:49,151
Okay, okay.

367
00:19:49,151 --> 00:19:51,236
Please, go on.

368
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:53,785
What happened next

369
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:57,012
Has brought me before you.

370
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,253
Just think

371
00:19:58,253 --> 00:20:01,397
As if I've made one foolish mistake.

372
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,550
Peace be upon you, Dad.

373
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,991
And upon you, peace. Where are you?

374
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:18,960
At the psychiatrist's clinic.

375
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,875
So you actually went there!

376
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,600
I couldn't believe it when your Mum told me.

377
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,456
Where is she?

378
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:30,661
She's with the doctor. It's been an hour.

379
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:32,646
She was alright, wasn't she?

380
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:34,236
She was, Dad.

381
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,066
Seeing the patients at the clinic, she said,

382
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,910
'I can't see a single mad man here'.

383
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,975
Tell her to talk to me when she comes back.

384
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,380
Sure.

385
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,435
But...

386
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:44,961
What?

387
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:47,252
She isn't going to get cured.

388
00:20:47,252 --> 00:20:49,442
Are you alright?

389
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:53,397
She went there just casually; otherwise, whatever is wrong with her?

390
00:20:53,397 --> 00:20:55,025
Nothing's wrong with her, Dad.

391
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,500
But she isn't ready to be cured yet.

392
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,520
What's this logic, mate?

393
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,609
Do you know what you're saying?

394
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:03,133
I'm telling the truth, Dad.

395
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:10,010
She's come to the psychiatrist because she, too, knows that she's --
-The psychiatrist will help her with her condition.

396
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,649
I've heard he's very intelligent.

397
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:17,730
He listens to the patient for hours, and solves the problem in moments.

398
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,455
Let's hope for the best.

399
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,230
Okay, Dad,

400
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,705
Bye.

401
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,550
Okay.

402
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,430
There was such a scene

403
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,080
When he brought his family along for the engagement.

404
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,104
And guess what,

405
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:40,310
They even brought a ring!

406
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,950
His Dad took it out of his pocket and showed it.

407
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,840
And, Monsieur le Docteur, it was the bleeding limit

408
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,180
That my Mum and Dad were chuffed, too!

409
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,340
They didn't even think

410
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,721
How a girl like Farah

411
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:54,100
Could ever even think about a wastrel like Afzal!

412
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,390
What happened, then?

413
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,651
What could've happened?

414
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,883
As if I'm meek as a lamb,

415
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:01,273
And I'd go along with him, bleating!

416
00:22:01,273 --> 00:22:03,559
Right at the time of the engagement,

417
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,100
I exposed him!

418
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,050
I shoved the engagement ring in his face.

419
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,846
<i>Right</i> in his face?

420
00:22:10,846 --> 00:22:11,961
No.

421
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:14,033
As in, refused to get engaged.

422
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,179
I showed him his place.

423
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:17,070
So, to speak,

424
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,360
'Shoved the ring in his face'.

425
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,055
Aye, figuratively speaking...

426
00:22:22,055 --> 00:22:23,816
Of course...

427
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,729
He'd be hiding his face in shame, then?

428
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:28,461
No, Monsieur le Docteur.

429
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:31,046
He left Hyderabad after that.

430
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:32,740
And honestly?

431
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,419
I did feel sorry that he left.

432
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:36,810
Why'd you feel sorry?

433
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,650
I mean,

434
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,555
Why'd you feel sorry for such a man?

435
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,430
His family's missing him a lot.

436
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,870
Looking at them,

437
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,956
I torment in pain, too.

438
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:49,261
That's strange...

439
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,292
He's having a ball in Karachi,

440
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,112
And people are tormented here for him.

441
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:54,256
Please, Monsieur le Docteur,

442
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:55,527
Don't say that.

443
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:56,732
Don't say what?

444
00:22:56,732 --> 00:22:59,383
That he's having a ball in Karachi.

445
00:22:59,383 --> 00:23:01,316
That's not what Dad thinks.

446
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:04,870
Forget about Daddy, tell me what you think.

447
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,590
The thing is,

448
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,210
If you saw him, you wouldn't really think he's the type.

449
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,860
Gambling's his only vice, really.

450
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,862
He'd even been acquitted in the case with Rosy.

451
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,369
Who's Rosy?

452
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,800
A blighter.

453
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,120
Turned out

454
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,470
She was drooling over him.

455
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,760
Dad ousted her.

456
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,710
Oh...

457
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,271
So she worked for you.

458
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,840
Interesting story,

459
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,470
And a bit funny as well...

460
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,650
Innit?

461
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,020
Alright, tell me,

462
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,401
Are you in the same condition now?

463
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,275
What condition?

464
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:43,736
Shutting up even so much as a thought of him.

465
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:45,993
Do you shut it up even now?

466
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:47,491
No.

467
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:48,966
If he comes to my mind,

468
00:23:48,966 --> 00:23:51,377
I do think about him...

469
00:23:51,377 --> 00:23:54,577
What, for example, do you think?

470
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,660
That he should come back to Hyderabad now.

471
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,420
It's better that he come here.

472
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,640
Why is it better for you?

473
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,960
I'm not talking about myself, Monsieur le Docteur.

474
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,350
If he stayed before his parents' eyes,

475
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,520
It'd give them peace.

476
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,541
Such noble thoughts...

477
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:13,262
Hmm... He ought to come back now.

478
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:15,726
What if he didn't?

479
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:18,400
He'd have to, Monsieur le Docteur!

480
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,237
Reverend Subhanallah's prayers won't go to waste!

481
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:24,102
And with his Mum having the Ayat'e Karima [Prayer for Relief from All Difficulties] recited,

482
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:25,920
How much longer could he keep running away?

483
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,290
Plus, I've vowed to offer 100 additional prayers.

484
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,390
You don't know, Monsieur le Docteur,

485
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,261
My wish gets fulfilled

486
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:36,390
Just after 12.

487
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,740
At least tell me what the doctor said.

488
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,215
I will,

489
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:33,150
But promise me

490
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,860
That you'd never go to a psychiatrist

491
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,670
If you had such a problem.

492
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,870
Why? What happened?

493
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,545
These psychiatrists are real wizards,

494
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:48,350
They even ask things one wouldn't even tell Mum and Dad.

495
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,810
So he asked you everything?

496
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,462
Yes...

497
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:54,359
And you told everything?

498
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,710
Of course.

499
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,555
Then?

500
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,780
What about your treatment?

501
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,180
Treatment?

502
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,580
So you think I'd gone there to get treated?

503
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,240
Do you know,

504
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,655
He called me a 'patient' by mistake.

505
00:26:05,655 --> 00:26:08,306
Had to apologise for it.

506
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,591
No good then...

507
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:13,547
No.

508
00:26:13,547 --> 00:26:15,750
He told me not to silence any thought of him.

509
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,831
He said there's nothing wrong about it.

510
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:19,572
He's got a point...

511
00:26:19,572 --> 00:26:21,670
You can't throw a thought out if you never let it in.

512
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,180
That's why...

513
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,650
Whose thoughts?

514
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,981
Afzal, of course.

515
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:31,812
So you told him that you think about Afzal?

516
00:26:31,812 --> 00:26:33,940
I don't think about him.

517
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,550
Just the occasional thought...

518
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,829
Blimey...

519
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,200
Is there anything wrong with that?

520
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,220
No.

521
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,880
Nothing wrong with it.

522
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,840
But tell me, what'd you tell Mum and Dad?

523
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,790
What'd I tell them?

524
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,660
Dad called me when I was there.

525
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:53,050
He asked me to call when leaving the clinic.

526
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,720
Mum's asked thrice, too,

527
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,190
'Why is it taking so long'?

528
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,415
I said, 'The treatment's taking time'.

529
00:26:58,415 --> 00:26:59,530
'Treatment'?

530
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,380
Yes --

531
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,285
I said whatever came to my mind.

532
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:05,196
But be prepared with your answer.

533
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:07,840
Think of what you'd say when Mum and Dad would ask.

534
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,270
Would you tell the truth or lie?

535
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,060
What truth do I tell them?

536
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,250
Just say that

537
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,015
You think of Afzal.

538
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:18,392
I'd never say that!

539
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:21,858
Yeah, yeah... You never even told <i>me</i>!

540
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:24,550
By the way, what kind of thoughts do you have?

541
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,560
Romantic, or

542
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,027
The bland <i>desi</i> type [South Asian, rustic, unsophisticated]?

543
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,718
As if I'd romance Afzal!

544
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:35,150
I know you won't, but who knows about thoughts?

545
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,146
Maybe, someday, in a romantic mood...

546
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:39,727
Shut up!

547
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:41,550
Honestly, though, Farah,

548
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,270
It's about time you brought out the sly lass hiding behind your veil of innocence,

549
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,510
And said openly, 'I won't leave anyone in peace until I've found peace myself'.

550
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,080
What do you mean?

551
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,390
You crazy lass,

552
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,860
Why are you toying with yourself?

553
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,739
If you love Afzal, just say that you do.

554
00:27:57,739 --> 00:28:00,390
Nobody will say anything.

555
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,102
For God's sake, Lubna,

556
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:04,820
I don't love Afzal!

557
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,090
At least think before you say something!

558
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,921
Me with Afzal --

559
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:10,121
Eww!

560
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,922
Never!

561
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,650
What happened?

562
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,649
Can't you believe it?

563
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,680
Not one bit.

564
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,051
Am I lying?

565
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,930
You're not lying,

566
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,985
But you don't know the truth.

567
00:28:34,985 --> 00:28:37,350
And it pains me to say

568
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,300
That the day you come to know the truth

569
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,970
Would be the day I'd say,

570
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,955
'You're lying'.

571
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,800
In that case, why don't you get this mirror out of here?

572
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,950
Here's your tea.

573
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,269
If my eyes fall on it while passing by, I take a look.

574
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:35,460
I'll say it straight, Mam,

575
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,610
Who doesn't like a pretty face?

576
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,660
Have your tea.

577
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,845
He's 25-ish, I'm sure.

578
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:50,556
At this age, a man with a fair face has already found a girl for himself.

579
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:55,752
What'd you do if he told you that he's found someone?

580
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:58,120
So what?

581
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,820
As if I bother!

582
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,480
I'd see your bothered self

583
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,960
In this mirror, then.

584
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,085
You wouldn't say, then,

585
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:09,540
'Get this mirror out, Mam'.

586
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,970
You'd say, 'Destroy this mirror'.

587
00:30:13,695 --> 00:30:15,580
Have your tea.

588
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,769
Give me one, too.

589
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,211
A cigarette?

590
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,821
Yes.

591
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:43,981
Why?

592
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:44,807
Just...

593
00:30:44,807 --> 00:30:46,420
Just feel like smoking.

594
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,410
Just get to the point and tell me what's in your heart.

595
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,590
The job as a security guard, you know...

596
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,010
I've agreed to do that.

597
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,150
As in,

598
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,880
We'll go to your friend tomorrow.

599
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,478
I'd apologise to him, and you can talk about the job.

600
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:05,140
But tell him I won't have my hair cut.

601
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,120
As if you're enlisting in the army! 'Hair cut'! Seriously?

602
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,780
Don't worry; I'll talk to him.

603
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,020
May --

604
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,660
May I sleep?

605
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,730
Sure.

606
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,669
Go to sleep.

607
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,610
She won't come by herself,

608
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,790
You could've climbed up the stairs and asked her.

609
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,760
Well, she'd only lie to me.

610
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,050
Who taught her to lie?

611
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,620
Only girls who conceal their heart's secrets from their mothers

612
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,600
Go to see psychiatrists.

613
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,400
Wow. That's rather well put.

614
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,305
But isn't this an insult to you?

615
00:31:59,305 --> 00:32:01,720
I mean,

616
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,390
Why would the daughter conceal her heart's secrets from her mother?

617
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,141
I think there's a communication gap.

618
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,048
I mean,

619
00:32:12,048 --> 00:32:13,410
She fears

620
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,480
You'd tell me whatever she told you.

621
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,570
Who else could I tell?

622
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,660
Why do you need to tell anyone?

623
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,560
Listen to her, and tell me your decision.

624
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,421
Just the what.

625
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:27,707
So would you do

626
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:29,120
As I say?

627
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,530
Of course.

628
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:37,010
But think over your decision carefully before telling me.

629
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,490
May I compliment you?

630
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,360
Why, right now.

631
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:46,480
You're the watermelon that's red on the inside.
-Hey!

632
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,710
Thank you.

633
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,761
Thank you very much.

634
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,010
So you're sleeping in my room today?

635
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,340
No?

636
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,340
You aren't afraid, are you?

637
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,300
Not at all?

638
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,700
I'm in no mood to talk.

639
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,245
I'm very sleepy.

640
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,860
You'd have to listen to one thing.

641
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,290
Done.

642
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,630
You'd have to reply, too.

643
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,400
I've always got my reply ready.

644
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,160
Shoot.

645
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,303
Tell me,

646
00:33:35,303 --> 00:33:37,511
What do I have to do to show you

647
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:39,910
That'd make you believe that I don't love Afzal?

648
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,560
What are your options?

649
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,900
You'd give me the options, right?

650
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,980
If you made me choose between death and him,

651
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,280
I'd rather die.

652
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,320
Blimey!

653
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,800
So much hatred!

654
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,591
I don't hate him.

655
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:55,441
But I don't love him.

656
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:00,600
Still don't believe it?

657
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,900
Pray tell,

658
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,470
Don't you have options either?

659
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,090
I've got one.

660
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,580
It'd shock you if you heard it.

661
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,570
You might even kill me right here.

662
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,120
I promise you,

663
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,070
I'll do anything,

664
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,940
But I won't even touch you.

665
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,350
Ready?

666
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:24,910
Yes.

667
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,220
Say it.

668
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,720
Think again - It may just kill you.

669
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,930
Put a sock in it!

670
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,680
My name's Farah Ibrahim.

671
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,550
I'm made of the same mettle as the mighty boulders.

672
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,100
Allow me, then...

673
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,952
Let me marry Afzal.

674
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,010
Good morning!

675
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,150
Oh!

676
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,975
Good morning.

677
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,430
Your bed tea!

678
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:52,200
Now for free! For you!

679
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,520
Where's Babu Hamid?

680
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,350
Babu Hamid's

681
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,404
Gone to get some milk and tea.

682
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,620
Isn't this

683
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,621
Too much of a formality?

684
00:36:06,201 --> 00:36:08,411
I'd have to have the second cup now.

685
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:10,500
I thought I'd have it here.

686
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,210
Because why not? It'd give you company, too.

687
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,879
Right...

688
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,880
Sit.

689
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,961
What's your wife's name?

690
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:29,636
Wife?

691
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:32,810
Haven't you gotten married yet?

692
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,450
No.

693
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,370
I get it.

694
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,840
What do you get?

695
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,735
You're having an affair.

696
00:36:45,735 --> 00:36:47,145
Innit?

697
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,440
No, I don't.

698
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Oh, shoot!

699
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,250
You're lying to Jasmine?

700
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,950
You're hiding it from me, right?

701
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,926
I don't lie.

702
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:57,107
I only lie to those I fear.

703
00:36:57,107 --> 00:36:59,040
So there's someone you fear!

704
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,350
Wow...

705
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,896
Who could that be?

706
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,140
Arifa.

707
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,445
My sister...

708
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:08,600
Reverend Subhanallah.

709
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,651
My Dad...

710
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,253
And your Mam?

711
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:16,360
I don't lie to Mum.

712
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,831
I just can't...

713
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:24,864
What've you come to Karachi for?

714
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,125
No idea.

715
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,181
But why are you asking?

716
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,050
Nothing, really.

717
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,971
Just a pastime.

718
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,829
Do you know how to read palms?

719
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,869
I do.

720
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:49,170
I can read the love line quickly!

721
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,265
Show me your hand.

722
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:51,680
No --

723
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,060
I don't believe in these things.

724
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,430
Dad starts saying 'No power but God's' if he sees it.

725
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,850
Such childish talk!

726
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,530
Is Dad around, watching?

727
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,450
The thing is,

728
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,160
I don't like it either.

729
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,000
That, or is it just that you're afraid of getting caught?

730
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,060
There's a line of love on my palm.

731
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,540
It's very long.

732
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,710
But I don't know where it leads.

733
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,140
Just show me the line.

734
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,681
I'll show it the way.

735
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,220
Good joke.

736
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,430
Nice tea.

737
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,101
Thank you.

738
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,090
Mam has fanciful suspicions about you.

739
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh?

740
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,311
Like what?

741
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:46,601
She thinks you're married,

742
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,001
Or you've got a girl after you.

743
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:50,961
But it isn't quite possible, really...

744
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,420
You're educated,

745
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,272
You look lush, too.

746
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:57,770
Surely, a couple of lasses would be dying for you.

747
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,150
First time someone said I look 'educated'!

748
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,880
Naw, you look like a hoodlum,

749
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,100
That's why everyone must think you're not.

750
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,350
But you just said I look lush?

751
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,340
True,

752
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,110
But a lush hoodlum.

753
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:15,970
When you beat Wali, I thought you're an ace at it.

754
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:21,069
I beat Wali for you, and you're calling me a hoodlum?

755
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,150
You beat him for me?

756
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,940
Who am I to you?

757
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:41,030
Say it straight, 'Jasmine, I'd lost my heart to you',

758
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,990
'I didn't like it that a hoodlum like Wali should boss over you'.

759
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,296
You're a Reverend's son,

760
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,647
At least be honest.

761
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:53,670
Anyway... It's better if you don't be honest now.

762
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,310
A tenant falling in love with the landlord's daughter is a classic.

763
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,000
I don't even believe such things...

764
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,000
