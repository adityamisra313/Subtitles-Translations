00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,450
Allow me, then.

8
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,956
I'll marry Afzal.

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,516
You're still up, aren't you?

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,566
Yes.

11
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:56,804
Are you alert or should we talk later?

12
00:01:56,804 --> 00:01:58,271
Why later?

13
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:00,400
Talk now.

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,489
Do you remember that we had a meeting right here by this door?

15
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,414
Yes, we did.

16
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:14,526
I remember it well.

17
00:02:15,018 --> 00:02:17,784
It was no ordinary meeting...

18
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:21,722
We had none of those 'Hi's, 'Hello's, 'Bye's or 'Good night's...

19
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:28,379
I think I'd come to you to convince you that I don't love Afzal.

20
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,091
Why, do you?

21
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,628
Shut up!

22
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:34,729
Let me finish it.
-Stay back while you talk --

23
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:37,519
You slapped me last night.

24
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,628
Ah, that!

25
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:42,288
So I wasn't dreaming after all!

26
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:47,474
So you'd actually asked me to allow you to marry Afzal?

27
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:49,449
That's what you said, right?

28
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:51,584
I did, but --

29
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,130
But what?

30
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,880
How long has this been going on?

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,256
What?

32
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:00,349
Don't hide anything now that it's out in the open.

33
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:01,699
Tell me.

34
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,461
You love him, don't you?

35
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:07,180
You're the one who writes letters to him under the name of Farah, right?

36
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,833
You're going ahead of yourself, Farah.

37
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,617
I'm looking ahead, Lubna!

38
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:12,771
Oh God...

39
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:15,038
What a guileful girl you are!

40
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:19,965
All of it was happening right under my nose, under my name, and I knew nothing of it!

41
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:21,495
It's nothing like that.

42
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:24,557
Now that you're abandoning him,

43
00:03:24,557 --> 00:03:25,869
I thought

44
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:28,353
I should marry him.

45
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:31,859
I never thought he was appalling.

46
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,994
Think how appalling you are to me right now!

47
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,011
I'm beginning to despise you!

48
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,980
In fact, despise is a small word --

49
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,073
Loathing is more like it.

50
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:44,356
Have you had your breakfast?

51
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:48,106
You want to talk to me about breakfast?

52
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,077
You better have some.

53
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:53,717
Or you might just eat me up.

54
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:55,607
What will I eat you up?

55
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:58,858
You'll eat yourself up like this.

56
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:00,175
Farah,

57
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,691
If it hurts you, you can decline.

58
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:07,493
But don't say all these harsh words to me.

59
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:10,455
Don't tell Mum and Dad.

60
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:11,759
Why shouldn't I?

61
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,612
That's unjust, Farah.

62
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:18,612
Remember, Farah, how I used to conceal everything when you asked me to?

63
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,972
So you've fallen so low?

64
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:24,323
What are you talking about, Farah?

65
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:27,270
If a girl thinks about marrying Afzal,

66
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,241
Will it be a sin to do so?

67
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,783
Belay the idea of 'a girl'.

68
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:33,867
Let's talk about me.

69
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,332
Is my marriage to him not acceptable?

70
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:40,130
Is he a leper or a pariah or something?

71
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,822
I always found him so handsome...

72
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,089
Yes,

73
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,677
He's a Reverend's son,

74
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,771
So he's a tad poor...

75
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,742
But he's got a heart too.

76
00:04:50,742 --> 00:04:53,158
You write him letters, don't you?

77
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:55,019
Why would I write him letters?

78
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:57,379
Do I have a phone to grind spices?

79
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,067
Although, to be honest,

80
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,973
Writing an SMS does not have the romantic appeal of a letter.

81
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:05,696
If you say another word,

82
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,616
I'll spit in your face!

83
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:09,661
Relax, Farah.

84
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:12,473
Sit down and think calmly.

85
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:14,478
When he is of no concern to you,

86
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,495
To the Devil with him!

87
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:18,145
He may love whoever he likes,

88
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:21,082
Marry whoever he likes!

89
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:23,384
He loves you too?

90
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:24,213
Hey!

91
00:05:24,213 --> 00:05:28,239
If you ask me with such fury, I'm not disclosing any secret.

92
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,084
D -- don't

93
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:30,990
Don't slap me!

94
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,129
You're incapable of being slapped!

95
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:36,942
You're a top-class vile

96
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:38,941
Gadabout!

97
00:05:38,941 --> 00:05:41,244
Gadabout?

98
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:49,749
When you offered me a job the other day,

99
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,936
I regretted my decision as I went back.

100
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:53,217
I told my wife,

101
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:55,609
'I've angered my would-be boss'.

102
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:57,529
She'd laugh if I told her today

103
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:01,204
That he came to his servant asking for a job.

104
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:03,129
Look, Shahnawaz, boyo.

105
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,124
Afzal has apologised for everything

106
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,000
That happened that day.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,546
He's very sorry.

108
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:10,362
How say we get back to work now?

109
00:06:10,362 --> 00:06:12,608
Back to work as in having him work for us,

110
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:13,562
Right?

111
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:14,489
Yes.

112
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:15,827
Look, Babu Hamid,

113
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:17,500
Don't make me risk this.

114
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,187
Your friend vents his anger on anyone.

115
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,578
I assure you he won't.

116
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:26,078
Ask him if he assures us.

117
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:29,949
Yes, I do.

118
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:31,144
Think carefully -

119
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:35,645
The toffs sometimes vent their wives' share of the anger on security guards.

120
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,979
Many even hurl abuses.

121
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,535
I won't listen to abuses.

122
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:43,222
Will you beat him in that case?

123
00:06:44,685 --> 00:06:46,222
Would you look at that, Babu Hamid?

124
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,431
I'm looking.

125
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:51,131
But tell me - who'd listen to abuses?

126
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:53,736
Well, yes...

127
00:06:53,736 --> 00:06:58,798
But I can't trust your friend, Babu Hamid.

128
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,631
Come, Afzal.

129
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,380
Thank you.

130
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,041
Wait.

131
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,867
You're hired.

132
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:25,006
I can trust you now.

133
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:40,798
Have you seen how they fear your anger?

134
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:42,359
Yes.

135
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,998
Some folks from the neighbourhood,

136
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,969
Wali,

137
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,060
And this friend of yours.

138
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,519
But I...

139
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,508
Fear that a man should fear another.

140
00:07:55,508 --> 00:08:00,170
But I fear when I think what you'd get working as a security guard.

141
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,829
10,000 a month?

142
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:04,218
You're not worth 10,000 a month, Afzal.

143
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,190
Your estimates run like my Mum's.

144
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,154
That's what she thought.

145
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,672
But nobody gives me more than 10,000.

146
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:13,812
My first job earned me 10,000 too.

147
00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:16,924
I mean, it did have quite some cachet...

148
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:21,139
I'd wear a shirt and trousers to job, with a tie...

149
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,046
I'll wear a uniform here.

150
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:25,456
A blue one!

151
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,422
To be honest with you,

152
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:32,376
You're expecting too much from me.

153
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:34,851
I'm not a man worth more than 10,000.

154
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,734
It's now been proven.

155
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:40,217
I'd get 10,000 if I work at Ibrahim Cottons,

156
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:44,000
And 10,000 if I work as a security guard.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,487
What will you do for your family with 10,000 a month?

158
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:50,281
Everything I'm doing is for my family.

159
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,970
When I can take care of my own expenses, I've saved my family 10,000.

160
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,845
Does your Dad earn enough?

161
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,135
He doesn't earn.

162
00:08:58,135 --> 00:09:00,316
He collects it directly from Him.

163
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:02,187
Who?

164
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,094
He's a priest at a Mosque.

165
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:09,815
He gets 40,000 to 50,000 as his divine reward.

166
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:23,814
Peace and Mercy of God be upon you.

167
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,749
O Lord!

168
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:47,998
Grant the childless a virtuous and righteous child;

169
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:50,559
O Lord!

170
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,732
Grant some peace to the hearts of parents;

171
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:57,481
O Lord!

172
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:02,794
Grant children such elegant civility that they can forgive their parents' fallibilities.

173
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:46,607
What's he doing in Karachi now?
-I don't have the foggiest.

174
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:49,916
Ask him to come back to work at my office again.

175
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,306
He's not in contact with me.

176
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:54,669
But I'm sure he's in touch with you?

177
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:58,169
His phone's switched off since the day he left.

178
00:10:58,747 --> 00:11:00,122
But

179
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:01,373
He...

180
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:05,012
Will contact me. He can't live without me.

181
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:07,588
Where in Karachi is he?

182
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:11,235
I only mention Karachi because

183
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:16,199
He used to say he'd run off to Karachi.

184
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,094
He didn't seem to be that type.

185
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:22,671
And he isn't.

186
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:25,843
I don't know what got into him

187
00:11:25,843 --> 00:11:29,188
That he severed all ties with us too...

188
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,048
I have full confidence in him

189
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:35,177
But his Mum worries...

190
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,865
She starts talking to God directly!

191
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,612
As if to say,

192
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:45,332
God Himself gave him a ticket and took him to Karachi.

193
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:48,190
If you say,

194
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,877
I can get someone in Karachi on him.

195
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,804
If he is in Karachi, it won't take more than a week to find him.

196
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:57,471
That will be a huge favour on me, Monseigneur Ibrahim.

197
00:11:57,471 --> 00:12:01,971
Once I find out where he is

198
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,735
I'll arrive at his doorstep

199
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,394
And bring him straight to your office.

200
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,497
Alright.

201
00:12:09,497 --> 00:12:11,311
Now, give me permission.

202
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:14,043
Please don't forget it.

203
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:17,359
Don't worry, I won't.

204
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:20,482
Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

205
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:35,962
Thank the Lord, he's fine.

206
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:37,844
But where is he?

207
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:41,612
A prophecy cannot tell where he is.

208
00:12:41,612 --> 00:12:44,220
Then how can it tell he's fine?

209
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,096
Mum! What are you saying?

210
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,592
If you can name the neighbourhood, I can find out the rest!

211
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:54,389
You're giving in to emotion.

212
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,062
That's all a prophecy could tell.

213
00:12:58,062 --> 00:13:03,172
So tell me about someone who can look at his numbers and get to his neighbourhood.

214
00:13:03,172 --> 00:13:05,890
Who could look at his numbers like that?

215
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,729
There is nothing like that!

216
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:10,449
Don't forget

217
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:14,470
That you're Reverend Subhanallah's wife.

218
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:21,556
Don't get swept away in emotions to believe in some unenlightened prophecy.

219
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:24,057
To be honest,

220
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:28,978
If there were a technique to find a lost son,

221
00:13:28,978 --> 00:13:30,962
I swear by God,

222
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:34,823
Mothers would be the first to know it.

223
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:36,825
It'd be better

224
00:13:36,825 --> 00:13:38,964
That you ask the Reverend

225
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:42,526
To go and find him.

226
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,752
My child,

227
00:13:45,752 --> 00:13:48,001
I think I should be going now.

228
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:00,967
Hey!

229
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,901
Mr Karim Ahmed! Peace be upon you.

230
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:06,189
And upon you, peace.

231
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:08,404
You're --

232
00:14:08,404 --> 00:14:09,496
Leaving?

233
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,967
Yes.

234
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:15,684
I'd come to prophesy about your Afzal.

235
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:19,589
Now, I can prophesy too, but

236
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,964
Ruqaiyya doesn't quite believe me.

237
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,214
When it's about her son,

238
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:30,152
A mother fears even his father.

239
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,074
There's always a suspicion

240
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:34,813
That, in the name of prophesying,

241
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:37,486
He may end up comforting her.

242
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:39,668
I take my leave.
-In the name of God; come.

243
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:42,011
Thank you very much.

244
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,710
Take that as well.

245
00:14:50,402 --> 00:14:55,541
Alright, I'll have something sweet [= I bring good news]

246
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,041
We'll get to know in a few days

247
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,010
Where he is now.

248
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,668
Why should I believe that?

249
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,418
If we'll get to know, what's with these 'few days'?

250
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:07,979
Because

251
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:11,312
Monseigneur Ibrahim has agreed to it.

252
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:13,214
He said

253
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:17,088
He'd be able to find him in a few days.

254
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:18,152
Just pray

255
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,764
That he

256
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:22,657
Had left for Karachi.

257
00:15:22,657 --> 00:15:24,359
What do you mean?

258
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,682
Has he not gone to Karachi?

259
00:15:26,682 --> 00:15:30,465
Good Lord, it doesn't mean that.

260
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:34,682
It's very likely he's gone to Karachi.

261
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:37,229
But your son

262
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:41,714
Loves to make the likeliest of things unlikely.

263
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:43,213
He's gone there.

264
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:45,081
When he said he'd go to Karachi,

265
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:47,825
Take it as if he dropped a hint.

266
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:50,357
Don't worry.

267
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:54,402
Our efforts to find him will begin in Karachi tomorrow.

268
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:57,775
Monseigneur Ibrahim has many contacts.

269
00:15:57,775 --> 00:15:59,479
He's promised me

270
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,964
And I'm sure he'll find him.

271
00:16:01,964 --> 00:16:05,638
It's also possible we may find out tomorrow or the day after?

272
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:08,748
It is indeed.

273
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:11,688
Arifa!

274
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,410
Arifa!

275
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,953
Get some dessert for your father.

276
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:20,164
Yes, his name's Afzal Subhanallah.

277
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:21,087
No.

278
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:25,051
I'm not saying 'Subhanallah' [praise the Lord] because of something he's done.

279
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,614
Yes, 'Subhanallah'.

280
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:34,776
Oui, Monsieur, that's his father's name!

281
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:40,153
You'd actually find yourself praising the Lord if you meet him!

282
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,806
He must be around

283
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:46,144
25, 26 years old?

284
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:48,358
Picture...

285
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:51,546
I can send you tomorrow morning.

286
00:16:55,369 --> 00:16:58,136
No, he won't be in a posh neighbourhood.

287
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:01,462
He doesn't have so much money.

288
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,276
Alright.

289
00:17:03,276 --> 00:17:05,355
You'll get his picture tomorrow.

290
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:06,917
Okay.

291
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:21,598
I felt pity for the Reverend today.

292
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:28,129
He didn't mention anything except righteous and duteous children in his prayers.

293
00:17:29,552 --> 00:17:32,300
I think I'll call on him one of these days

294
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,706
To give them hope.

295
00:17:33,706 --> 00:17:36,585
Why not call on him tomorrow?

296
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:39,158
Give him some consolation over tea,

297
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:39,839
And

298
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,018
Bring a picture of Afzal when you come back.

299
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:46,989
We're going to need one to find him.

300
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,426
Alright.

301
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,706
I'll go tomorrow.

302
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,314
But...

303
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,345
But what?

304
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:56,581
Wouldn't it seem rather strange -

305
00:17:56,581 --> 00:18:00,236
Farah's mother asking for Afzal's picture?

306
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,768
Why?

307
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:05,206
Just say, 'We're trying to find your son'.

308
00:18:05,206 --> 00:18:08,333
'It'd help us if we had a picture'.

309
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,751
Now he's no minister

310
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,908
That I'd say his name, and those looking for him would say,

311
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:12,743
'Oh'!

312
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,623
'<i>That</i> fellow'!

313
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:17,344
But Farah will ask why we're looking for him.

314
00:18:17,344 --> 00:18:21,021
You'd only know if you met her psychiatrist!

315
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,351
What would I know?

316
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,807
He asked me the moment he saw me, 'Do you know someone by the name of Afzal'?

317
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:28,721
I said, 'Yes, I do'.

318
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:31,844
Smugly, he said, 'He's fled from Hyderabad'.

319
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,851
'You better find him and bring him back, or --'
-'Or'?

320
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:37,595
'The affliction will become immedicable'.

321
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:39,317
What's her affliction?

322
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,991
By the Lord, Irsa Begum,

323
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:45,330
Don't ask me to name it.

00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:39,181
How long have you been here?

334
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,963
What is going on?

335
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,384
What's going on? I'm just singing a song.

336
00:19:43,384 --> 00:19:46,574
Oh wait, I got it wrong, let me try again...

337
00:19:46,574 --> 00:19:49,759
♪<i>I've tasted b--</i>♪
-Stop it, Lubna!

338
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,916
Get me through to him.

339
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:53,089
Who?

340
00:19:53,089 --> 00:19:57,089
That blighter Afzal. Who else could it be?

341
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,128
His phone's switched off.

342
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:02,954
Give me the number that's active.

343
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:04,661
He doesn't have any other number.

344
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:10,004
It's impossible that Juliet's singing romantic songs when she's been out of touch with her Romeo!

345
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,831
We're not in touch right now.

346
00:20:12,831 --> 00:20:17,158
I do try his number every night before I go to bed.

347
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:19,688
The wretch keeps it switched off!

348
00:20:19,688 --> 00:20:22,118
So it's gotten so far!

349
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:25,163
There are no limits in love.

350
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:27,235
Things can go to any lengths.

351
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:31,388
Don't forget you're Monseigneur Ibrahim's daughter!

352
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:33,469
I never do.

353
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:36,469
Now... Let go of my hand.

354
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,574
I'll only marry him if things go forward.

355
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:46,760
I won't elope with him.

356
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,590
Alright.

357
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,623
I'll go and tell Mum.

358
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:51,909
Get ready

359
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,449
We'll call him from Karachi and get him married to you!

360
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,526
Really?

361
00:20:56,526 --> 00:20:58,010
What does it look like?

362
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,482
I swear, Mum won't say no if you talk to her!

363
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,510
She'll even convince Dad!

364
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,745
You'd talk today, won't you?

365
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:07,339
Not just today.

366
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:08,933
Right now!

367
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,517
There!

368
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:13,782
My heart was right.

369
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,368
How?

370
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:17,467
My heart said

371
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:19,509
It is only on Farah's face that you can see such fury.

372
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:21,477
She's like a candle on the inside -

373
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:26,306
She'd melt as the slightest of warmth touches her.

374
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:42,813
Right,

375
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:44,782
What is it, Farah?

376
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:46,635
Where's Dad?

377
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:50,435
He turned in after the news bulletin.

378
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,553
Please, sit.

379
00:21:58,401 --> 00:22:00,058
Okay.

380
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:02,338
Go on.

381
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:06,737
Say something; Get on with it.

382
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:09,040
Get Lubna married off.

383
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,560
Splendid.

384
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,432
So this is what you wanted to say.

385
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,839
Is it you who's got this itch,

386
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,449
Or her?

387
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:20,154
Tell me!

388
00:22:20,154 --> 00:22:22,544
Where does this thing about her marriage come from?

389
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:24,341
Nowhere...

390
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:25,637
I was just thinking --

391
00:22:25,637 --> 00:22:27,203
She'd just as well go to her home.

392
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:30,092
She'd go to her home and you'd slouch about here.

393
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,967
When did I say I'd slouch about here?

394
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:35,287
Do you want me to talk to your Dad?

395
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,694
To Dad?

396
00:22:36,694 --> 00:22:38,481
Why?

397
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:40,638
What will you say?

398
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:42,744
He should know too

399
00:22:42,744 --> 00:22:46,039
That his sweet little girl is thinking about the entire family now.

400
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,132
Also,

401
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:50,543
You better not show me that you're certifiable.

402
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:53,131
I used to act up like this

403
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:55,979
When I was stopped from marrying your Dad.

404
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,537
Act up?

405
00:22:57,537 --> 00:22:58,709
Don't worry.

406
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:03,069
Your Dad's picked up a lead, and he'll dig something up about him in a few days.

407
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:04,459
Who?

408
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:07,098
As if you don't even remember his name!

409
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:08,832
You're talking about Afzal?

410
00:23:08,832 --> 00:23:10,820
Of course.

411
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,650
Why is Dad looking for him?

412
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,021
Has the doctor prescribed any medicines or just shooed away after taking his fees?

413
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,804
He didn't prescribe anything.

414
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:21,009
In fact, he said I'm perfectly fine when he heard my history.

415
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,776
He's lied to you.

416
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,960
But he's told your Dad the truth.

417
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,988
Please, listen to me!

418
00:23:27,988 --> 00:23:28,804
I --

419
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:31,084
I've made a promise.

420
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:32,602
To whom?

421
00:23:32,602 --> 00:23:34,788
And what have you promised?

422
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,255
I walked up to the terrace

423
00:23:36,255 --> 00:23:39,082
She was on the swing singing a song from 'Ram Leela'!

424
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,615
What's 'Ram Leela'?

425
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:43,309
Deepika's film!

426
00:23:43,785 --> 00:23:47,224
I'll tell her Dad --
-What's the need?

427
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:48,722
Don't you remember that you'd said,

428
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:51,128
'When a girl sits all alone, singing',

429
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,521
'She's yearning to get married'.

430
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:54,394
Well,

431
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:56,519
Haven't you proven this adage false?

432
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,768
Neither did you sit all alone,

433
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:58,960
Nor did you sing,

434
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,166
But you dropped the bombshell that was Reverend Subhanallah's son on us.

435
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,098
Anyway,

436
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:08,472
I'll hear her sing myself.

437
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:09,399
Go now,

438
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:13,222
And have faith, instead of thinking of unnecessary things,

439
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,892
That in a few days,

440
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,598
He'd be back at the crossroads around here.

441
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,924
Or perhaps gambling on a match

442
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:23,188
With the old colony lads.

443
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,520
Here.

444
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,754
Put your book down and have this before it cools down.

445
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:12,101
Here.

446
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,001
Right,

447
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,690
So what were you saying?

448
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,083
What was I saying?

449
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,171
The same

450
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:21,860
You were telling me about Afzal's wife.

451
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,641
For the love of God, Mum,

452
00:25:23,641 --> 00:25:26,408
He's not gotten married yet

453
00:25:26,408 --> 00:25:28,593
And he's got no girlfriend either.

454
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,763
Girlfriend?

455
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:33,203
I mean, he's not having an affair with any girl either.

456
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:36,275
When did you ask him this one?

457
00:25:36,275 --> 00:25:41,024
I asked everything when I brought him his tea.

458
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,082
Why?

459
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,848
Hey!

460
00:25:42,848 --> 00:25:44,102
It's because you'd said

461
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:47,082
He'd be married or have found a girl.

462
00:25:47,082 --> 00:25:49,007
So I thought I'd better ask.

463
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,177
I should know, too,

464
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:53,522
If your guesses are correct or you just say what you feel like.

465
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:56,225
What'll you do now?

466
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:58,920
I mean, what are you up to?

467
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,936
What would I be up to?

468
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:02,641
I'm just asking.

469
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:06,375
What should I do if he suddenly disappears one day?

470
00:26:06,375 --> 00:26:08,553
He's deposited some advance for now.

471
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:10,405
We don't need to get worried.

472
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:12,937
Besides, he's a Reverend's son; he won't defraud.

473
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:15,126
I'll have two or three delicacies cooked tomorrow.

474
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:16,199
Why three?

475
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,202
Two would be enough!

476
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,473
One, chicken, and two, some vegetables and lentils.

477
00:26:19,473 --> 00:26:21,834
And afters just once a week.

478
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,717
And the same old 8,000 a month.

479
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:27,955
What's with the month, Mum, it'll go by in a flash!

480
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:29,474
Who could it be at this hour?

481
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:30,965
Who else could it be?

482
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,489
Wali won't be coming now.

483
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:34,555
One of the tenants, maybe, or Samina.

484
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:36,318
I'll have a look.

485
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,919
I've brought sweets!

486
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,524
Just so little?

487
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,467
Why, though?

488
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:50,822
Oh God!

489
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:52,399
You haven't gotten married, have you?

490
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:53,869
Not at all!

491
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:55,492
I haven't gotten married.

492
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:57,571
I've got a job.

493
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:58,946
God bless you!

494
00:26:58,946 --> 00:27:00,322
Thank you!

495
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:01,496
Where have you got a job?

496
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,922
I mean -- what's your designation?

497
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:14,197
Just a pastime?

498
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,530
Just a pastime.

499
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,380
Hello there!

500
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:45,369
Why are you sleeping here?

501
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,700
Just --

502
00:27:49,948 --> 00:27:52,188
No idea.

503
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:56,390
You forgot your promise, didn't you?

504
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:58,385
Promise?

505
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,886
You said it firmly last night,

506
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:03,559
'I'll talk to Mum about you and Afzal'.

507
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,058
'In fact, I'll get him here from Karachi and get you two married'!

508
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:08,809
There!

509
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:11,123
Chickened out, eh?

510
00:28:11,748 --> 00:28:15,266
One needs guts to stand by someone, Mademoiselle Farah Ibrahim!

511
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,324
Remember

512
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:19,935
I'd put my life on the line for you!

513
00:28:19,935 --> 00:28:22,362
I'd talked to her.

514
00:28:22,362 --> 00:28:23,390
Hey!

515
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,752
Why didn't you tell me?

516
00:28:24,752 --> 00:28:27,465
Stay back when you talk!

517
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:31,568
Did she agree to it?

518
00:28:32,975 --> 00:28:34,006
I don't know

519
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,412
Whether she'll agree to it or kill you!

520
00:28:36,412 --> 00:28:39,554
For now, I've just said you want to get married!

521
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:42,021
I didn't mention Afzal.

522
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,710
Why not?

523
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,490
You're actually saying

524
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,600
That I should mention him by name?

525
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,696
Hey!

526
00:28:48,696 --> 00:28:50,647
Do you still doubt me?

527
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:52,087
Come on, Farah.

528
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:54,865
I'm very serious.

529
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:56,948
In fact,

530
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:59,039
I'm thinking of getting Afzal's name

531
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,398
Tattooed on my arm!

532
00:29:03,194 --> 00:29:04,069
Honestly though,

533
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:05,372
It did occur to me

534
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:07,773
That you won't be able to mention him.

535
00:29:07,773 --> 00:29:09,212
The thing is,

536
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:11,944
I know your problem very well.

537
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:13,727
What's my problem?

538
00:29:13,727 --> 00:29:15,653
You've only got one, Farah...

539
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,069
It's just yesterday

540
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,219
That your marriage to Afzal was being planned.

541
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,132
And now, out of the blue, you'd name me,

542
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:23,507
And Mum and Dad would get to know the true story,

543
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:25,602
It would knock them for six for sure.

544
00:29:25,602 --> 00:29:27,788
What's the true story?

545
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:30,467
Do I have to say it over and over again?

546
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:31,259
Alright,

547
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,164
I'll tell you everything when I'm back from University.

548
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:35,304
Oh God, I'm late!

549
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:38,745
I better get going. Have a good day!

550
00:29:57,938 --> 00:29:59,749
Wait.

551
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,143
Yes, Mum?

552
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:05,685
Is it true, what Farah said?

553
00:30:05,685 --> 00:30:07,249
What'd she say?

554
00:30:07,249 --> 00:30:12,871
You were on the terrace last night singing songs from 'Ram Leela'?

555
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:15,592
How's the film?

556
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:17,481
It was great --

557
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,533
Actually -- it ain't --

558
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,810
I haven't even watched it, Mum.

559
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,559
Just checked out the song.

560
00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:27,059
Come back from University,

561
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,995
And we'll talk.

562
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:29,871
Alright.

563
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,074
Bye.

564
00:30:53,149 --> 00:30:57,182
I'll lose 40-50 million but go on with the business!

565
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:59,421
Peace be upon you, sir.

566
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,456
Did I forget to greet you, sir?

567
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:20,331
I think I did.

568
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:22,723
Remember me?

569
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,520
No, sir?

570
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:32,510
I remember meeting you but I don't remember where.

571
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,766
Yes, sir.

572
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,401
Look here.

573
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:41,312
Remember me?

574
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,620
No, sir...

575
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,947
The name's Mehtab.

576
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,296
Right, sir.

577
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:52,083
You still don't remember me?

578
00:31:52,083 --> 00:31:55,343
I'm trying to, sir.

579
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:56,742
What's your name?

580
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:58,390
Afzal.

581
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:01,195
Afzal...

582
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:03,482
What happened, M. Mehtab?

583
00:32:03,482 --> 00:32:06,469
Nothing.

584
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:09,170
Peace be upon you, sir.

585
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:22,140
You're the same, aren't you?

586
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,622
The same, sir?

587
00:32:24,622 --> 00:32:29,375
We met at Uncle Ibrahim's!

588
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,510
Remember?

589
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,480
Listen!

590
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,609
I watched Ram Leela in the afternoon.

591
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:54,938
It's not the kind of film you twits should be watching!

592
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:57,910
It's not the kind of film you should be watching either.

593
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,859
And -- I didn't watch it, Mum --

594
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:01,734
Just listened to the song.

595
00:33:01,734 --> 00:33:03,578
I sang it because I liked it...

596
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:06,266
Good that your Dad wasn't home!

597
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:09,817
Otherwise, I would've said that I'm watching it because of Lubna.

598
00:33:09,817 --> 00:33:11,935
God forgive...

599
00:33:11,935 --> 00:33:13,543
But the song was good.

600
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:14,548
Wasn't it?

601
00:33:14,548 --> 00:33:15,730
Put a sock in it!

602
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,059
Don't sing it again.

603
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:20,497
You'd be doomed if Dad heard it!

604
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:22,822
What does Dad know it's from Ram Leela?

605
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:24,355
Forget it...

606
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:27,214
I'm sure he's watched it already.

607
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:30,918
Anyway,

608
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:33,794
You were on the terrace, singing, weren't you?

609
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,014
Yes...

610
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,765
What are you up to?

611
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,184
Up to --?

612
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,667
I'm your mother.

613
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:42,919
My hair haven't turned grey,

614
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:46,800
But I'm experienced enough to know the signs of girls who sing songs sitting all alone like that.

615
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,199
Tell me,

616
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:51,727
If you are in love with a boy too, tell me his name.

617
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,187
I'll talk to your Dad today.

618
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:55,806
For God's sake, Mum --

619
00:33:55,806 --> 00:33:59,088
So do you intend to hide it for a year or so too?

620
00:33:59,088 --> 00:34:00,197
Look, my dear,

621
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:03,353
The two of us are used to such shocks.

622
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:08,210
You can't put the wind up us by naming any stone broke dosser!

623
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,105
Feel free to name anyone who isn't even 'Afzal' [the best] in name.

624
00:34:14,105 --> 00:34:15,492
Shall we talk tomorrow?

625
00:34:15,492 --> 00:34:16,599
Tomorrow?

626
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,537
Alright, we'll talk tomorrow.

627
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:20,008
But remember

628
00:34:20,008 --> 00:34:22,179
The lad should be a real one.

629
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:26,460
Don't hire another actor for 200,000 or something.

630
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,865
No way, Mum --

631
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,273
I won't do anything like that.

632
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:31,023
I promise.

633
00:34:34,076 --> 00:34:35,877
So you've handpicked him!

634
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:37,122
That's great.

635
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:38,639
Long live my daughters.

636
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,812
You've taken up your father's responsibilities with such timing!

637
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:44,926
May I go?
-Go.

638
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:49,442
Warn me an hour before you tell me his name.

639
00:34:49,442 --> 00:34:50,492
Warn you?

640
00:34:50,492 --> 00:34:55,674
Just give me a hint that you'd be naming him in an hour.

641
00:34:55,674 --> 00:34:57,381
But why, Mum?

642
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,347
What if the doctor is busy at that time?

643
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,572
No way!

644
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:04,878
Your Dad's blood pressure shoots up in minutes.

645
00:35:04,878 --> 00:35:06,758
It won't come to that.

646
00:35:06,758 --> 00:35:12,393
It's screaming to come to that, but you can't hear it. Go.

647
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:14,446
And keep on singing -- whatsit,

648
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,081
'I've tasted blood'!

649
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,774
God forgive!

650
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:42,327
Don't come in!

651
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:47,429
And don't you dare touch the door to my room without my permission!

652
00:35:47,429 --> 00:35:49,835
Talk only from where you are!

653
00:35:49,835 --> 00:35:51,961
Call out to me right from there.

654
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,056
I'll only talk if I'm in the mood to,

655
00:35:54,056 --> 00:35:56,836
Otherwise, you don't need to call out a second time.

656
00:35:56,836 --> 00:35:59,007
You're picking up a quarrel with me!

657
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:01,162
That's what's to be decided now, Lubna Ibrahim -

658
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:03,631
Which of us is picking a quarrel with the other!

659
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,538
Then you, too, should only call out to me standing at my doorstep.

660
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:08,558
I'll only talk if I'm in the mood to,

661
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:11,075
Otherwise, you don't need to call out a second time.

662
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:14,335
'Come to your doorstep' my foot!

663
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:15,851
Ohh...

664
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:17,568
I can understand everything...

665
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:19,163
Everything.

666
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:20,789
I should be of help to you

667
00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:23,168
Even as you feign love,

668
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,936
And you'll cumber the path

669
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,059
Of my true love?

670
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,324
Splendid!

671
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:30,480
You truly love him?

672
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,513
The one who came with a proposal to marry your sister?

673
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:34,512
Hello?

674
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:36,324
All of that was an act.

675
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:38,940
You two were just playing your parts!

676
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,495
Not him. He actually brought his parents.

677
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,731
And that -- Engagement ring...

678
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:45,812
Do you remember?

679
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:48,855
I'd even texted him a message to mark the end of the job and his love!

680
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:50,347
So you think

681
00:36:50,347 --> 00:36:53,328
He'd actually fallen in love with you?

682
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:54,417
Well,

683
00:36:54,417 --> 00:36:56,629
I wouldn't call it love.

684
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:58,904
The blighter used to have an exchange of letters with someone,

685
00:36:58,904 --> 00:37:01,402
And wanted to marry me!
-Please, Farah!

686
00:37:01,402 --> 00:37:04,183
Don't cast such an aspersion on my Afzal!

687
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,699
<i>Your</i> Afzal?

688
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:08,757
He's yours now?

689
00:37:08,757 --> 00:37:10,763
He will be.

690
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:12,782
When you yearn for someone so ardently,

691
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:15,386
He cannot end up anywhere else.

692
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:16,605
But

693
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:20,952
What do you know about ardent yearning!

Listen!

702
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:16,317
Where to?
-Samina's.

703
00:39:16,317 --> 00:39:19,943
Today's her wedding anniversary.

704
00:39:20,761 --> 00:39:22,738
As in, it's been another year.

705
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:25,492
Is hers the kind of wedding one would commemorate?

706
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:27,472
Her husband does every year.

707
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:29,620
After all, it's her husband's 'love marriage' to her.

708
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,581
In two years of this 'love marriage', she's been beaten by her 'lover' some 200 times!

709
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,131
Only the Lord will ask them about that.

710
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:38,929
What will you give her as a gift?

711
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:40,597
Why would she need one?

712
00:39:40,597 --> 00:39:43,044
She needs cash much more.

713
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:44,753
I think I'd give her a thousand.

714
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:48,161
And who will get the security guard his food?

715
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:50,066
I'll be back before he is.

716
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:53,113
And who'll tell you he's back?

717
00:39:53,113 --> 00:39:54,228
Well,

718
00:39:54,228 --> 00:39:55,939
I get to know

719
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:59,936
The moment he sets foot in the alley!

720
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:03,738
May I go now?

721
00:40:03,738 --> 00:40:05,084
Yes.

722
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:07,067
Go.

723
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:11,060
But please do tell me when you're back

724
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:16,060
How you get to know the moment he sets foot in the alley.

725
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
