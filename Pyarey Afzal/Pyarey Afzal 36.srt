7
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,870
Oh God!

8
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,356
She's suddenly taken to praying!

9
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:21,610
Be done with it and tell me what's wrong this time!

10
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,287
God knows what she's praying for!

11
00:02:27,987 --> 00:02:30,406
I was praying that this Sunday not fall on the 27th.

12
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:32,750
Or that the 27th not be a Sunday.

13
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,590
Are you touched in the head?

14
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,300
I'm getting married this Sunday, you blighter!

15
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,410
No you're not.

16
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,376
I've prayed you don't!

17
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,227
You're envying your own sister?

18
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:48,325
Do you remember

19
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,876
How you said that you're making this marriage happen?

20
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:53,260
I said I made the engagement happen.

21
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,760
So slow down!

22
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,940
What can be done now?

23
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,170
When Farah thinks of something, her decision is final.

24
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,060
You don't need to think anything.

25
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,570
Your engagement was no engagement!

26
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,871
That was a part of your treatment!

27
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,519
What?

28
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:16,696
You mean --

29
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,217
That bleeding psychiatrist was treating me?

30
00:03:20,217 --> 00:03:24,147
We were both of the opinion that you'd need a different kind of shock therapy.

31
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:26,027
You love someone else

32
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,286
And you're not ready to admit it.

33
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:30,657
And that blighter said with complete confidence,

34
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:32,296
That the moment it'd come to marrying him,

35
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,936
You'd shriek,

36
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:38,077
'No way, I can't marry Sibtain'!

37
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:41,120
So he doesn't love me?

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,386
He was conniving!

39
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:46,136
You don't love him either.

40
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:47,616
You were conniving too!

41
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,870
You were just getting even with Afzal.

42
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,420
Afzal again?

43
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,836
Who the devil is he?

44
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:56,077
And whose is he?

45
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:58,266
The Farah from the letters?

46
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,487
You?

47
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:02,497
And now that blighter Jasmine --

48
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:04,310
Well,

49
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,730
Jasmine's my friend now;

50
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,810
I won't call her a blighter...

51
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,694
I was never with him, Farah.

52
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:13,555
I was lying.

53
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:14,455
Lying?

54
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,256
I was just putting up a show.

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,076
Because of that dolt Sibtain.

56
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:20,585
The blighter read a bunch of his books

57
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:24,986
And said, 'If you name Afzal, she'll say with evident agony -'

58
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:26,040
'"Shut up, Lubna"!'

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,950
'"Don't even think about him"!'

60
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,940
Yeah, right...

61
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,010
Remember when I slapped you and said,

62
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,930
'Don't even think about him'!

63
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,430
But you stopped there!

64
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,070
What should've I said?

65
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,020
What you can't bring yourself to say;

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,020
What that unfortunate bloke couldn't muster the courage to say.

67
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,290
You've killed each other,

68
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:54,230
Too reluctant to accept that you love each other.

69
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,020
I've said it a hundred times over and will say it a thousand times more,

70
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,840
I don't love Afzal!

71
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,537
I DON'T LOVE AFZAL!

72
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,686
Sit down.

73
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,960
Here's all the letters

74
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,650
Besides the one in your possession.

75
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,160
They're not letters, Jasmine.

76
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,290
They're an unsung chronicle of love

77
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,430
That ended

78
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,297
When I got engaged to you.

79
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,040
Take this

80
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,870
And torch these with your own hands.

81
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,960
Just think as if

82
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,840
Afzal had a dream since his childhood days;

83
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,740
His dream unfulfilled, he felt too ashamed to even talk about it.

84
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,920
Don't look at me;

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,886
I'll never tell you who wrote these letters.

86
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,386
Will you torch these, or should I?

87
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,160
No one will torch them, Afzal.

88
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,301
Letters written in love are not to be burnt.

89
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,610
You kiss and lift them to the eyes,

90
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,650
And hold on to them like a holy book that touches the heart.

91
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,090
You are under my oath, Afzal -

92
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,240
Burn all you want in the flames of her searing remembrance,

93
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,881
But never burn these.

94
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,060
Arifa, I want to meet Farah.

95
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,050
Right now?

96
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,290
Right now.

97
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,550
Have you asked him?

98
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,890
I won't ask him.

99
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,940
I'll tell him when I'm back.

100
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,620
Does she go to bed by 11?

101
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,080
I don't know.

102
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,060
Then call her.

103
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,050
Tell her

104
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,890
I must see her.

105
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,670
And...

106
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,950
What is it exactly that you want?

107
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,080
Nothing, really.

108
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,830
I've got a few questions in my heart.

109
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,277
I just want to satisfy myself.

110
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:22,487
I'll talk to Lubna.

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,980
Hello, Arifa!

112
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,210
How are you?

113
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,550
I don't know.

114
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,410
Hey?

115
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,350
What happened?

116
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,410
To be honest, I'm furious!

117
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,620
I feel like murdering that chuffing Farah!

118
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,920
She's getting married this Sunday.

119
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,236
Why do you need to murder her now?

120
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Don't tell me she's rejected the proposal!

121
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,090
No.

122
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,020
That's exactly why!

123
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,916
She's determined.

124
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:08,660
Alright; by the way

125
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,490
Jasmine wants to meet her.

126
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,020
Everything alright?

127
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,630
I don't know.

128
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,380
She said that she wants to meet her right now.

129
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,420
Tell her to come over.

130
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,460
But how will she come?

131
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,670
Tell her to get ready.

132
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,930
I'll send a car.

133
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,140
Thank you.

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,030
Shut up, mate.

135
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,660
The car will be there in ten minutes.

136
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,346
Okay.
-Bye.

137
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,810
Would you look at that, Ruqaiyya Begum?

138
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,760
He's rubbing my feet to sweeten me up!

139
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,380
Yeah, and I can see how you're not sweetening up!

140
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,768
Let's just say

141
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:30,070
I can no longer feel that warmth...

142
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,310
There's this knot in my heart now.

143
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,660
Keep at it, dear.

144
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,302
It'll untie this knot.

145
00:10:41,746 --> 00:10:48,110
Do you remember, when I had the heart attack, you said,

146
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:54,987
'The Reverend has been overcome by the father'?

147
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,730
You were right.

148
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,476
Yeah, you were...

149
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,860
If a Reverend is more fatherly,

150
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,650
He may succumb to a weakness of honour.

151
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:18,480
Not that I've been dishonoured, really,

152
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,170
But, still,

153
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,680
I am in no position to avouch.

154
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,370
Why are you laughing?

155
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,626
I'm feeling sleepy,

156
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:38,366
And

157
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:43,707
I haven't even taken any sleeping pills!

158
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,158
Is everything alright?

159
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:52,896
Nothing's alright.

160
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:55,986
There's something new every day!

161
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:57,476
Where is she?

162
00:11:57,476 --> 00:11:59,159
Sleeping.

163
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,790
She'll wake up today.

164
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,139
Upstairs?

165
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,939
Yes.

166
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,117
Stay here.

167
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:11,716
Just tell me where her room is.

168
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:17,950
Go up and turn right. First room on the left's hers.

169
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,280
Open your eyes!

170
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,141
I'm actually here!

171
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,690
I don't believe this.

172
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,130
Is everything alright?

173
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,011
Get up. We need to talk.

174
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:20,742
I'm up.

175
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,922
What is it?

176
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:25,620
I've got a few questions, Farah.

177
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,880
Will you answer them?

178
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,390
Ask away.

179
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,980
Do you know Miss Mary?

180
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,070
Miss Mary?

181
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,200
No, I don't know her.

182
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,860
The year was 2007.

183
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Where were you studying back then?

184
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,170
I was doing my O-Levels back then...

185
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,120
Oh, yeah -- Just a minute.

186
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,216
Miss Mary D'Souza was a teacher at my school.

187
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:52,947
Blimey, was she stern!

188
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:56,930
She used to get angry a lot; perhaps it's because she was a divorcee...

189
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,590
How did you find out about her?

190
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,220
I don't think even Lubna remembers her name.

191
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,580
You'd mentioned her in a letter to him.

192
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,520
You'd threatened him,

193
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,369
'If you waited in front of the school or tried to look at me, I'll have you caught'.

194
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,150
Who'd I write that to?

195
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,341
Afzal.

196
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,150
I've got the letter in my bag if you want to read it.

197
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,910
I don't need to read it.

198
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,190
I know there's someone who writes him letters.

199
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,750
Her name is Farah.

200
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,350
And I'm getting a bad name because of her.

201
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,336
There's just one way now, Jasmine.

202
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:36,130
Grab Afzal by the collar and ask him,

203
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,980
'Tell me'

204
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,250
'Who is this Farah'?

205
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,190
Why shouldn't I ask you first?

206
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,660
Why is the name of that Farah's teacher Mary D'Souza?

207
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,300
Perhaps that's why you're marrying a psychiatrist.

208
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,530
You know, deep down, that you're ailing.

209
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,596
If he's not willing to tell me,

210
00:14:55,596 --> 00:14:57,620
You're not willing to admit it either.

211
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,790
You wrote these letters, Farah.

212
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,940
It's possible

213
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,147
That you fell in love with him sometime

214
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:08,410
And, afflicted with that love, you wrote those letters.

215
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,350
But you realised later on

216
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,406
That he's not your class!

217
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:15,827
This is why you hide your face in shame,

218
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,050
Lie to everyone,

219
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:22,436
And tell everyone that it's some other Farah.

220
00:15:22,436 --> 00:15:24,447
You're getting married this Sunday, aren't you?

221
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:25,687
That's it.

222
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,160
It's just a problem until your marriage.

223
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,240
You'll be cured,

224
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,731
And so will he...

225
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:41,022
He holds on to your letters even now.

226
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:44,781
He's forgotten everything else he should've held on to.

227
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:46,841
Wake up, Farah.

228
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:49,240
Don't ever sleep in peace

229
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,263
With the knowledge that you've given many others sleepless nights.

230
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,930
Ask the driver to drop me home.

231
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,937
Come.

232
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,777
I've given her such a slosh she'll be left wondering.

233
00:16:36,777 --> 00:16:38,456
What'll she be left wondering?

234
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,970
Just

235
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,790
What this Jasmine is made of!

236
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,700
So,

237
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,230
What are you made of?

238
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,270
I've said it clearly to her,

239
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,340
'You used to write letters to Afzal'.

240
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,870
Why did you say that?

241
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,536
Miss Mary D'Souza

242
00:16:52,536 --> 00:16:53,910
Was a teacher at her school.

243
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,130
Tell me, then,

244
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,940
If it's her teacher who's mentioned,

245
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,490
She's the one who wrote those letters, isn't she?

246
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,610
She's not admitted it yet.

247
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,747
But now, she's within my grasp.

248
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:10,250
I couldn't dare imagine!

249
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,796
For the love of God,

250
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:15,530
How much my brother has been humiliated because of those letters!

251
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,340
I'm here now,

252
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:22,970
And I'll leave only after I've got the truth from her.

253
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,880
Didn't Mum ask you where you had gone?

254
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,310
No... But she was staring at me quietly.

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,100
What's this?

256
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,590
Afzal's diary.

257
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,600
He used to write it everyday up to his FA [A-Level] days.

258
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,407
There's another one from after he'd completed his FA [A-Levels].

259
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:46,640
I've gone through both of them

260
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,920
But found no clue.

261
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,770
May I read this?

262
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,560
Let me see what he used to write.

263
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,760
Go on.

264
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,061
'If love were a cricket match, I would've won'.

265
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,560
'I gambled for the first time today'.

266
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,680
'Won 500 Rupees'.

267
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,440
'I gave them all to Arifa',

268
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,320
'And Arifa is the kind who pulled me up, asking where I got it from'.

269
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,390
'What could I do'?

270
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,406
'I saw her anger and lied to her'.

271
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,080
What's the matter?

272
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,691
Just a second.

273
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,730
Whatever is it in that letter?

274
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:32,120
She's got wind of who wrote those letters.

275
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,400
And the clue lies in the one she's got in her bag.

276
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,120
Why is she doing this, Ruqaiyya?

277
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,370
Searching and probing like this, she

278
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,450
Will lose something which is hers.

279
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,750
Where is she?

280
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,550
Call her here.

281
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,690
I will talk to her.

282
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,580
Come in, my dear.

283
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,737
She's outside, waiting for you to call her.

284
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,900
What is all of this, my dear?

285
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,300
You're remembering the one

286
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,560
Who should've been forgotten?

287
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,640
And you're reminding him, too?

288
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,400
No way.

289
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,790
Give me that letter.

290
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,690
In fact, bring me the rest of them too.

291
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,830
We'll consider it a sacrificial offering

292
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,080
To mark your engagement when we burn those letters.

293
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,480
Who'll you serve those coconut biscuits?

294
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,990
Who'll you see and say, 'When she comes, it feels as if Afzal has come'?

295
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,710
I do not need such consolations, my dear.

296
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,935
Afzal's here now.

297
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,330
I'm afraid you'll lose him again

298
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,272
If she got married this Sunday.

299
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,230
Did she write those letters?

300
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,540
Yes.

301
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,520
No.

302
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,990
That's completely wrong.

303
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,890
That can't be.

304
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,530
She didn't write those letters -- She --

305
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,870
She was ready to swear on the Holy Qur'an.

306
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,000
She was telling the truth.

307
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,979
She wasn't lying one bit!

308
00:22:30,956 --> 00:22:34,340
She wasn't lying one bit, yes.

309
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,760
But she'll accept it today

310
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,670
That she wrote the letters.

311
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,596
You should accept it too. Please.

312
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,360
The car's here.

313
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,270
Car?

314
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,957
I'm going to meet Farah.

315
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,970
Please, allow me.

316
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,280
You've met her last night too.

317
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,420
You didn't ask for my permission last night.

318
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,230
I thought you'd stop me because it was late.

319
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,180
And I feared that I'd go regardless.

320
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,100
I didn't want to disobey you.

321
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,970
What'll you do today?

322
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,190
I won't allow you today either.

323
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,850
I'll go regardless.

324
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,947
For now, I'm obligated to disrespect this command.

325
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,520
What did she just say, Ruqaiyya?

326
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,580
How respectfully has she said

327
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,570
That she'd disrespect my command!

328
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,540
She's pronounced her judgement as she left, Reverend.

329
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:17,320
She's decided she won't live under the same roof as Afzal.

330
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,870
What happened?

331
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,120
Who was there in the car?

332
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,636
Jasmine.

333
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:18,020
Try as much as you like, Jasmine, she won't admit it.

334
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,090
She will, today.

335
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,370
The circumstances and evidence have changed.

336
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:29,100
She'll be saying to you in a while that she's written the letters.

337
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,570
Where is she?

338
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,200
In her room as usual.

339
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,360
She's suddenly started offering additional prayers.

340
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,030
Go up, turn right, first room on the left, right?

341
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,026
Yes.

342
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,537
Don't come upstairs today.

343
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,610
Seriously.

344
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,989
Don't.

345
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,167
Hold it there!

346
00:26:26,326 --> 00:26:31,050
Offer the rest of your prayers after I've left.

347
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,947
I dropped in again, didn't I?

348
00:26:32,947 --> 00:26:35,030
Sorry, Farah, but I had no option.

349
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,466
I've sworn I'd leave only after having you admit it.

350
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:42,460
Admit what?

351
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,046
Sit.

352
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,900
Say that you're the Farah who wrote those letters.

353
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,190
I swear by God --
-Don't!

354
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,060
Just say it for someone's sake.

355
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,010
Why should I say it, mate?

356
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,550
Because the Farah who wrote those letters isn't anyone else.

357
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,490
What?

358
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,650
What do you mean?

359
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,470
Alright, remember -

360
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,000
Sometimes,

361
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,920
Sometimes, you saw him outside the school

362
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,560
And sometimes, at the gates of your college.

363
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,930
Yeah, I did...

364
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,450
In fact, I saw him outside the college very often.

365
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,620
Because Arifa used to study there.

366
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,350
He used to come to pick her up.

367
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,284
He came to see you, Farah.

368
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,930
He used to glimpse you, secretly.

369
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,700
You, the daughter of the owner of Ibrahim Cottons,

370
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,460
And he, the son of a poor Reverend.

371
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,230
That is why he never mustered the courage to say anything or talk to you.

372
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,340
So?

373
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,230
And when he felt

374
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,360
That he'd never be able to talk to you,

375
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,530
To tell you that he loves you,

376
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,520
He took the other road to his love.

377
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,430
What?

378
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:18,000
He started writing letters from you to Afzal.

379
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,281
All that he'd wanted to tell you,

380
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:28,362
He believed he had,

381
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:31,790
And all that he wanted to hear from you,

382
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:37,900
He wrote in his letters which he'd read to his friends.

383
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,790
He believed in his mind

384
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:44,620
That you loved him,

385
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,000
But also accepted

386
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,070
That you can never be his.

387
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,910
I feel sorry for him...

388
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,360
Yes.

389
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,560
I feel sorry for him too.

390
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,537
He's admitted it?

391
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:05,885
Obviously,

392
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:08,040
He would've admitted when he's been caught.

393
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,000
He's been caught, Farah.

394
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,160
But he hasn't admitted it

395
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,870
Because I never asked him to admit it.

396
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,830
That's your fault, then.

397
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,710
He's your fiancé.

398
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,660
You should've grabbed his collar and said,

399
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,730
'Hey Mister'!

400
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,650
'What's going on here'?

401
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,730
As if it started today;

402
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:34,240
As if it'll end tomorrow...

403
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,350
This will go on until he dies, Farah,

404
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:41,900
Or love itself dies.

405
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,957
Interesting...

406
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,410
So, now you want

407
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,420
That I forgive him.

408
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,510
No, Farah.

409
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,540
Now, I want that you confess it.

410
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:20,000
Admit it that you love Afzal

411
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,540
And admit it

412
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:27,126
That you had written all those letters.

413
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,950
Very funny.

414
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:32,220
I don't think I'm crazy like you!

415
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,270
Honestly,

416
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,920
Are you actually his fiancée

417
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,690
Or just say it to scare us?

418
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,190
You could say that...

419
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:47,370
I just say it to scare you.

420
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,190
The blighter had scared me when he first met me.

421
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,610
He said, 'I'll throw you out'!

422
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,770
No!

423
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,610
He didn't throw me out.

424
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,020
Just

425
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,106
Said it for the sake of saying.

426
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:07,837
He doesn't know how to talk to girls.

427
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:13,690
He'll learn when he talks to you.

428
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,490
But now that he's been with me for a few days,

429
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,760
He's learnt something.

430
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,950
He said it very politely when he came for the engagement,

431
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,150
'Will you get engaged to me'?

432
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,910
It felt as if --

433
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,200
As if --

434
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,080
He'd cursed me!

435
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,680
Cursed?

436
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:34,270
Who in the world says, 'Will you get engaged to me'?

437
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,640
If he loved me, he would've said,

438
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,411
'Will you marry me'?

439
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,460
I swear by you,

440
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,950
I would never have thought about who writes him letters!

441
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,260
Whether you're the Farah or someone else,

442
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,640
I would've trampled her underfoot!

443
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,210
He deserved a girl like you

444
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,840
Who'd break others to pieces for his love.

445
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,280
But he only wanted you

446
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,330
Who'd broken him to pieces.

447
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:12,630
He'd come from Hyderabad a broken man.

448
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,080
One who comes broken from Hyderabad

449
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,470
Cannot be patched in Karachi.

450
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,876
He said to me a day before the engagement, 'Jasmine',

451
00:32:21,876 --> 00:32:23,496
'I don't love you'.

452
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:27,950
And I'd known he'd say that

453
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,600
Because he never knew any love

454
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,967
Except <i>his</i> love.

455
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,600
So, when he came to talk about the engagement, it felt

456
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,340
Like he'd come to amuse me.

457
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,230
You were getting engaged that day.

458
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:52,099
He'd come to settle a score.

459
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,670
I, too, thought, 'Get on with the engagement'.

460
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,290
'What's the big deal'?

461
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,330
'The moment he'd turn to look back',

462
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,806
'The engagement would break'.

463
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,050
I'm getting married this Sunday.

464
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,100
It'll all be clear this Sunday.

465
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,610
You'll see,

466
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,550
He'll marry you this Sunday.

467
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,020
He'll settle a score again.

468
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,870
Why, Farah?

469
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,400
Why must only you two play this game of settling scores?

470
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,660
How say I play my move this time?

471
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,740
And when I do, you'll realise,

472
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,650
That one who comes broken from Karachi

473
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:47,066
Cannot be patched in Hyderabad.

474
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,627
Don't break your engagement!
-Oh, never...

475
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:55,620
I would never.

476
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,880
But what do I do about him?

477
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,120
When he startles at the sound of your name,

478
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,610
The engagement breaks.

479
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,390
No -- He's nobody to me;

480
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,310
I know he's Arifa's brother,

481
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,210
The Reverend's son,

482
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,890
And now also that he writes letters to himself under my name...

483
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,830
The blighter!

484
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:23,906
You love this blighter.

485
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,930
No?

486
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,550
You'd die without him.

487
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:34,310
Very funny.

488
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,170
You look for him when you can't find him around,

489
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,680
And when you look for him, no one else can get him.

490
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,180
Oh -- No, it's nothing like that!

491
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,850
I don't love him!

492
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,010
I don't even think about him!

493
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,030
Y -- You can

494
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,970
Y -- You can have me swear on it!

495
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,700
Y -- You can have me swear on it!
-Alright.

496
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,927
Y -- You can have me swear on it!
-Alright. Swear on it.

497
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,990
Swear by God you don't love Afzal.

498
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:06,750
He's watching you right here,

499
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,220
Show Him;

500
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:14,076
Tell Him you don't love Afzal.

501
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,220
She's found out that this Farah had written the letters.

502
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,000
How?

503
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,540
How'd she find out?

504
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,270
Miss Mary D'Souza was a teacher at Farah's school.

505
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,670
She mentioned her name in a letter.

506
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:44,076
The same letter which Jasmine has in her bag.

507
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,310
There's just one way left for you.

508
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,940
Swear to God and say

509
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:58,319
That you don't love Farah Ibrahim.

510
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,570
You're Reverend Subhanallah's son.

511
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,240
You wouldn't swear a false oath, would you?

512
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,330
Stop.

513
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,720
What about Jasmine?

514
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,100
She'll be coming back after having her admit it for real.

515
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,900
And what if she actually admitted to it?

516
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,520
What about your engagement?

517
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,510
It'll break, won't it?

518
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,770
Won't it?
-She'll never admit it.

519
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,287
She'll swear over it and say she'd not written the letters.

520
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:35,910
And it is indeed true, Arifa. She didn't write those.

521
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,320
Then Miss Mary D'Souza -- Her handwriting --?

522
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,550
I told you

523
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,796
That's not her handwriting.

524
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,920
Don't you feel ashamed to think

525
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,330
That she loves you, and she's looking

526
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:04,846
For the one you love?

527
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,220
Come.

528
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,416
Come on, mate.

529
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:18,150
You started down the path of God. Where'd you end up?

530
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,940
Nowhere.

531
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:28,790
You just left Hyderabad and ended up in Karachi.

532
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,400
And here you are, thinking whether

533
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,510
You've never left Hyderabad,

534
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,089
Or never returned from Karachi.

535
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,896
How are you, Mr Fiancé?

536
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,096
Come in.

537
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,000
I saw you playing cricket.

538
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,580
You're such an ace, mate!

539
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,690
Don't say 'mate;' Dad may hear it!

540
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,530
Allow me these parting discourtesies, my love;

541
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:29,340
Who knows what may become of me

542
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,845
Who knows what may become of me and you?

543
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,530
Tell him to not look at me with such fury!

544
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,340
Don't look at her with such fury!

545
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,150
Why did you go there?

546
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,117
Eh?

547
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,890
For the sake of Uncle Reverend's coconut biscuits.

548
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,820
Please agree to what I'm saying!

549
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,480
And for your Mum's sake.

550
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,000
She finds you in Farah.

551
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
