Don't you feel ashamed to think

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,583
That she loves you, and she's looking

9
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:43,127
For the one you love?

10
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,509
Come.

11
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:49,148
Come on, mate.

12
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:56,430
You started down the path of God. Where'd you end up?

13
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,200
Nowhere.

14
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,029
You just left Hyderabad and ended up in Karachi.

15
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:10,700
And here you are, thinking whether

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,760
You've never left Hyderabad,

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,426
Or never returned from Karachi.

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,140
How are you, Mr Fiancé?

19
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,086
Come in.

20
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,316
I saw you playing cricket.

21
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:59,910
You're such an ace, mate!

22
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't say 'mate;' Dad may hear it!

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,798
Allow me these parting discourtesies, my love;

24
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:07,660
Who knows what may become of me

25
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,686
Who knows what may become of me and you?

26
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,790
Tell him to not look at me with such fury!

27
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,640
Don't look at her with such fury!

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Why did you go there?

29
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,686
Eh?

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,080
For the sake of Uncle Reverend's coconut biscuits.

31
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,030
Please agree to what I'm saying!

32
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,750
And for your Mum's sake.

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,720
She finds you in Farah.

34
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,060
And for your sake, M. Afzal,

35
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,096
For I see her in your eyes.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,140
It occurred to me that you'd gotten engaged for my happiness;

37
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:24,728
For your happiness, then, I thought I'd break this engagement.

38
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,580
Uncle, ask him

39
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,790
To return my ring.

40
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,327
You're under my oath!

41
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,256
What are you saying?

42
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:08,270
Please, Jasmine.

43
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,940
Don't say such things...

44
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:19,980
I've made a promise to the Reverend,

45
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,410
And you're so one-sided -

46
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,600
You agree to everything the Coconut Girl says;

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,935
Won't you agree to one thing I said?

48
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,275
Dad's crying, Jasmine...

49
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:51,270
He loves you so much.

50
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,019
I love him so much too!

51
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,780
I, too, will tear up when I'll remember him.

52
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,516
C'mon!

53
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,835
Return my ring.

54
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:20,110
Mam was asking me on that day, 'What kind of engagement is this'?

55
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,406
'Which the boy's parents didn't attend'?

56
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,130
I said, 'Thank God he's here'.

57
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:45,969
'I would've agreed to the blighter's proposal had he asked to get engaged over the phone'.

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,700
I'm keeping it to show it off before Mam!

66
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,320
I'll tell her it's a long term engagement,

67
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,091
And I'm waiting a lifetime for the marriage...

68
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,376
C'mon now.

69
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,247
Drop me at my place.

70
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,130
I'd written all those letters, Lubna...

71
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,686
What letters?

72
00:08:59,686 --> 00:09:01,180
The same

73
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,011
That Afzal has.

74
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,490
A lie.

75
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,210
You're lying.

76
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't say 'You're lying' now that I've accepted it.

77
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,860
I've been caught because of Miss Mary D'Souza.

78
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,976
I would never have admitted it.

79
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,730
And when you'd gone to Afzal's place after ritual purification,

80
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,020
And said to his mother that you can swear on the Qur'an,

81
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,296
Why did you say that?

82
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,060
You were ready to commit such a grave sin!

83
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,170
I knew she wouldn't let me.

84
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,291
Good Lord!

85
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:52,140
I'm so ashamed already...

86
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,590
Forgive me... Please...

87
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,946
Try to make a list

88
00:09:56,946 --> 00:10:00,748
And see how many people you'll need to apologise to, and how many will forgive you.

89
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:04,040
Dad will punch you right in the jaw!

90
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,100
I'm determined now, Lubna...

91
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,990
I'll take it.

92
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,040
And when God asks you,

93
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,350
What will you do about that?

94
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,270
Jasmine's taken care of it,

95
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,527
She said, 'Confess the sins of lying and breaking him'.

96
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:23,330
'I'll weep for you and ask forgiveness for you'.

97
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,199
She was weeping?

98
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:27,136
A lot.

99
00:10:27,136 --> 00:10:30,160
She loves Afzal so much...

100
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,680
One-sided.

101
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,460
And that blighter loves <i>me</i>.

102
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,506
So she sacrificed herself for you.

103
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,566
I'd tried to dissuade her,

104
00:10:39,566 --> 00:10:40,850
I said,

105
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,080
'Marry him'.

106
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,858
You're so simple...

107
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:49,270
But she said, 'Be uncharitable in love'.

108
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,238
'Had I been in your place',

109
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:53,367
'I would've trampled everyone underfoot'!

110
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,728
You must've learnt that instantly,

111
00:10:55,728 --> 00:11:00,959
Seeing how you trampled Jasmine underfoot in a moment!

112
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:07,478
I love Afzal, Lubna...

113
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,480
Tell me, then,

114
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,190
What do I do?

115
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,500
Call Sibtain,

116
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,450
Say to him, 'I'm not marrying you'.

117
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,040
Why don't you --?

118
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,006
Poor chap's a good man.

119
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,796
I guess I'll have to now...

120
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,110
Else, everyone's going to say,

121
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,966
'These girls just like to get things started',

122
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,606
'They never get things moving forward'.

123
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,786
It's my sacrifice for you!

124
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,060
Call her here.

125
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,530
Tell her her dresses are ready.

126
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,710
Tell her to have a look, get ready; we're leaving.

127
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,950
Where's Mum?

128
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,580
At the jeweller's; she told me to come with her.

129
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,840
She's selecting the jewellery?

130
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,056
Of course!

131
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Come with me.

132
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,346
Get these upstairs.

133
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,360
D -- Dad...

134
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,560
Please endure this final bulletin --

135
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,040
Final bulletin?

136
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,120
Slap me if you get angry.

137
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,420
But say to Mum it's my decision.

138
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,190
I mean -- yours.

139
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,120
Don't say a word about Farah.

140
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,720
I don't want to hear any news about her.

141
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,984
I promise, Dad.

142
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,000
I won't say anything about Farah.

143
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,370
Have no fear, then.

144
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,166
Tell me - what is it?

145
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:30,040
Uh --

146
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,006
Dad -- It's --

147
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:33,395
You know -- Sibtain?

148
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,047
What happened to him?

149
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,190
Nothing!

150
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,216
Please listen patiently.

151
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:41,876
Alright, go on...

152
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,877
It's --

153
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:47,310
Dad, Sibtain was --

154
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,546
Actually for me.

155
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:50,505
I mean -- he --

156
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:52,337
The proposal --

157
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:54,800
Was intended for me.

158
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,740
What?

159
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,740
I swear, Dad.

160
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,000
But I said, 'There's one condition'.

161
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,930
What condition?

162
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,570
You're getting angry, aren't you?

163
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,386
Blimey, I'm not getting angry!

164
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:09,130
Get over with it.

165
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,710
The condition was that

166
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,990
He'd cure Farah completely.

167
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,390
Cure her?

168
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,700
What do you mean?

169
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,370
Dad, she's cured!

170
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,990
She's admitted that she used to write those letters to Afzal!

171
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,590
Nobody will mention Afzal in this house now!

172
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,590
Let me finish, Dad!

173
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,360
Isra will die if she heard anything like this!

174
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,956
She's in on it, Dad!

175
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,590
I've french fried your brain, haven't I, Dad?

176
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,010
But this time, the mistake wasn't Farah's.

177
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,050
I've fried it this time.

178
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,640
For God's sake, what will Sibtain's parents think?

179
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,960
Nothing at all!

180
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,530
They're in on it too!

181
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,990
Why did you have to conceal it from me, then?

182
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,660
You can't act, Dad!

183
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,780
We thought it'd be better if you performed naturally!

184
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,600
So she's 'cured'!

185
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,170
Completely, Dad!

186
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,790
Don't you all think it's a bit too late now?

187
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,320
Be honest with me -

188
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,140
Have I been more of a father to you or a friend?

189
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,210
A friend, of course.

190
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,700
Tell Farah, then, that no friend would ever advise her

191
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,660
To even think about Afzal.

192
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,790
You're saying this because of Jasmine, right?

193
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,576
She's no more --

194
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,620
I mean, she's breaking the engagement.

195
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,440
She's the one who explained everything to Farah.

196
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,750
She said that the engagement was just like Sibtain and Farah's 'marriage'.

197
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,260
Only that she'd been a tad bit serious.

198
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,910
But Afzal was just getting even.

199
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,692
Even -- as in, Farah got engaged the other day,

200
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,180
So he got envious and got engaged on the same day.

201
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,660
He's committed 12 murders in Karachi, Lubna.

202
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,260
He'll have to pay for them all.

203
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,520
She'll have him pay for it.

204
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,800
She'll ask him why he did it.

205
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,900
He must have an answer too.

206
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,330
Otherwise, he'll just say sorry --

207
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,130
Come on, Lubna...

208
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,450
Let me think like this, Dad...

209
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,060
He's back now.

210
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,350
He's playing cricket here in Hyderabad.

211
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,130
Let him play.

212
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,117
Don't talk about murder.

213
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,747
How far is Karachi, anyway?

214
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:14,208
Here you go and there you arrive!

215
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,526
Don't cry, Aunt.

216
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:20,730
We'll talk over the phone.

217
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,480
I'd never talk to you.

218
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,300
Tell me,

219
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,270
Who am I to talk to you?

220
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,430
You're family.

221
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,680
The one-sided engagement, remember?

222
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,920
Given that, you're my mother-in-law.

223
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,346
50-50.

224
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,496
Where's Uncle?

225
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:02,900
He'd be in his room, crying...

226
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,946
I thought I'd meet him.

227
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,530
It's me, Uncle... Jasmine.

228
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,220
May I come in?

229
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,536
Don't you dare set foot in the room!

230
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,470
I don't want to meet you!

231
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,966
Not at all!

232
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,760
Please allow me...

233
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:59,180
I'll be there in your heart even after I'm gone...

234
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:05,160
Every time you'd look at the Coconut Girl, you'll bless me.

235
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,020
Scold me if it's a lie.

236
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,416
Otherwise, let me go.

237
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,240
I have to,

238
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,390
Whether you grant me leave,

239
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,057
Or not.

240
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,630
God be with ye...

241
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,540
You're leaving because Farah used to write letters to me, right?

242
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,908
Let me tell you the truth...

243
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:24,829
She didn't write those letters to me.

244
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,410
I used to write those letters myself under her name.

245
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,180
No.

246
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,960
That's not why I'm going.

247
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm going because

248
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,190
That blighter loves you.

249
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:44,620
So much that she cannot bring herself to say it.

250
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:51,676
She started crying buckets and buckets when she was about to say it.

251
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,300
Who is it?

252
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,130
Sibtain and his father.

253
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,010
Why are they here?

254
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,750
And why are they laughing?

255
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,180
They're happy

256
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,590
That Sibtain's not getting married to you.

257
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,786
Oh seriously!

258
00:22:56,786 --> 00:23:01,317
As if I'd marry that ignoble psychiatrist!

259
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,180
What were you looking at over there?

260
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,290
Afzal was going somewhere with Jasmine.

261
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,460
Look at how she turned away!

262
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,270
She didn't even meet me as she left!

263
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,030
Don't be so happy about it.

264
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,530
She's left this place with tears in her eyes.

265
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:29,180
Bless her in your 12 prayers now that you're getting married to Afzal.

266
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,256
Did you talk to Afzal?

267
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,920
Not even now?

268
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,950
Ask <i>him</i> to talk to me.

269
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,890
You're both trapped in these issues.

270
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,610
He couldn't say it, and nor could you.

271
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,580
<i>I</i>'m never saying it.

272
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,730
Alright.

273
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,820
Wait until the marriage.

274
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,780
You'll come out with it all.

275
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,956
Where are you going?

276
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:58,260
Downstairs.

277
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,340
The date of your marriage is being decided.

278
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,811
Dad's saying you'll get married this Sunday and the next Sunday will mark the celebrations.

279
00:24:03,811 --> 00:24:06,870
But -- Uncle Reverend didn't even talk about it...

280
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:11,676
The two of <i>them</i> don't have such issues as <i>you two</i>!

281
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,950
There was one Jasmine,

282
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,760
Who loved my brother,

283
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,650
But my brother

284
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,210
Loved Farah.

285
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,500
Seeing it, one would believe that if love is one sided, it becomes more than mere love,

286
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,720
but what does love turn into

287
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,220
When it becomes something

288
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,160
More than mere love?

289
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:22,160
It's midnight, isn't it?

290
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,516
Yes.

291
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:29,860
Why did you set an alarm for midnight?

292
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,220
I figured

293
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,200
He would've arrived by midnight.

294
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,026
He must've arrived there.

295
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,651
We're going to Monseigneur Ibrahim's tomorrow.

296
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,100
Are we invited?

297
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,500
What are you saying, Ruqaiyya Begum?

298
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,050
It's the girl's family.

299
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,060
Why would they invite us?

300
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,920
We'd go to them!

301
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,500
We'd beseech them humbly,

302
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,380
'Please'

303
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,670
'Be so generous'

304
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,922
'As enrapture us by giving us Farah'.

305
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,486
Jasmine?

306
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,956
Jasmine, wake up. We're at your place.

307
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,936
Thank you.

308
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,548
Listen.

309
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,820
Won't you ask me to come in?

310
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,630
No.

311
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:24,981
I'll start to grow on you if you come inside.

312
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,821
You'll forgive me, won't you?

313
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:34,991
Did you call Farah?

314
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,690
Call her.

315
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,810
Tell her how much you love her.

316
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,006
I'll forgive you that instant.

317
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:54,200
Take care.

318
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,600
Listen...

319
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,800
If you ever visit Karachi...

320
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,967
Do not pay me a visit.

321
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,410
Did you call Farah?

322
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,390
Call her.

323
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,510
Tell her how much you love her.

324
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:35,656
I'll forgive you that instant.

325
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:59,580
Dear Afzal,

326
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,990
Do you know the most undeniable truth in the world?

327
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,000
Don't guess.

328
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,290
Hear it from me:

329
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:13,870
The most undeniable truth in the world is that

330
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,730
Farah Ibrahim

331
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,969
Loves you.

332
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,936
Hello?

333
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:46,437
Afzal --

334
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,150
Yes, Afzal?

335
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,590
Go on; why did you stop?

336
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,976
Afzal?

337
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,640
Do you have the slightest shame?

338
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,670
Farah, let's go --

339
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,080
Hey! Get off!

340
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,100
Let me see who's the boss!

341
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,110
Now that your engagement plan failed,

342
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,800
You stand in my way to get even?

343
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,980
You're playing the lover in front of everyone?

344
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,860
Want to besmirch my reputation?

345
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,970
You're Reverend Subhanallah's son,

346
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:39,220
So I thought you wouldn't step out of the house for days after all the insult that day.

347
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,750
You'd drown in shame,

348
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,170
Or leave Hyderabad to hide your disgraceful self!

349
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:21,831
Hello?

350
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,211
Farah here.

351
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,780
I know --

352
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,510
The call got disconnected?

353
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,776
Yes --

354
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:39,250
Disconnected.

355
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,560
So what was it you were saying?

356
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,471
I was saying --

357
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,020
That's what you always do.

358
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,510
It's either that you can't say,

359
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,451
Or can't say the whole thing.

360
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,490
Go on.

361
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,082
I'm listening.

362
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,740
Farah,

363
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,266
Yes...

364
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,240
Say something after 'Farah' and you'll see

365
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,638
How everything just flows naturally!

366
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,981
Hello?

367
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,920
Tell me...

368
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,770
Why did you call me?

369
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,090
I wanted to talk to you about the letters.

370
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,590
Yes, go on?

371
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,420
Move on from the letters.

372
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,276
But, I --

373
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,696
Alright.

374
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:00,690
I'll start.

375
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,176
But -- You finish it.

376
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,180
I wrote all those letters.

377
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,820
For you.

378
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,830
To you.

379
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,906
A fib...

380
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,660
All the letters, I --

381
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,380
I wrote them myself.

382
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,800
To you...

383
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,680
Sorry --

384
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,380
Why are you saying sorry?

385
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,910
You were right.

386
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,640
So what if you'd written them?

387
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,620
Go on.

388
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,550
These long pauses of yours, Afzal,

389
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,569
Something's not right.

390
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,630
It's cost a lot before.

391
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,020
C'mon, be a man!

392
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,060
Tell me clearly that --

393
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,650
You love me.

394
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,521
That's it --

395
00:37:16,022 --> 00:37:17,610
What's it?

396
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,750
I love you...

397
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:25,702
So much...

398
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,950
But Farah,

399
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,130
Don't say 'Farah' like that...

400
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,970
I might die when I hear it.

401
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,990
There you go again!

402
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,440
Listen,

403
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,900
I've written a letter to you.

404
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,790
For real this time.

405
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:58,586
I'll post it tomorrow, and you'll get it in a day.

406
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,270
Don't ask me what I've written,

407
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:07,000
Just...

408
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,891
Know that it opens with 'Dear Afzal'.

409
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,440
You're so shameless.

410
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,005
Said it to my face that you love me so much!

411
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,870
Now, I'm a girl;

412
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,510
I have to think.

413
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,840
I've written it after a lot of thinking.

414
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,750
I'm not telling you anything else.

415
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,630
You're on the way, aren't you?

416
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,550
When will you get back?

417
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,467
Tell me...?

418
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,009
Please tell me...

419
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,890
Hello..?

420
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,720
Please?

421
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,990
How many times to I have to tell you, Afzal,

422
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,560
Your silence costs all of us so much.

423
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,386
Your silence costs all of us so much.
